description: Insights, guides, notes and ideas about completely switching to Linux.
---
Even though [[Linuxplosion]] runs Linux, specifically Ubuntu, 99,9% of my computer time is spent on a MacBook Pro 13' 2019 running, guess what, MacOS.

Even though I hate everything about the capitalist premises of the company who owns and develops it, **I love MacOS** and to be honest most of my life *depends* on it. Nevertheless, since I hate proprietary software, especially if coming from a huge ugly corporation like Apple, I hope that the day where I will have the strength drop everything and exclusively use Linux will come soon.

For this purpose, I am gathering here resources for when I will be ready.
