Even though [[Linuxplosion]] runs Linux, specifically Ubuntu, 99,9% of my computer time is spent on a MacBook Pro 13' 2019 running, guess what, MacOS.

Even though I hate everything about the capitalist premises of the company who owns and develops it, **I love MacOS** and to be honest most of my life *depends* on it. Nevertheless, since I hate proprietary software, especially if coming from a huge ugly corporation like Apple, I hope that the day where I will have the strength drop everything and exclusively use Linux will come soon. I would love to avoid consumerism, capitalism and monopolies as much as possible, without compromising stability, performance and reliability.

For this purpose, I am gathering here resources for when I will be ready.

## Linux on my MacBook Pro

Buying another device just to start using Linux earlier than I would is exactly the opposite of what I am trying to accomplish. Therefore, I decided I would start test how Linux would feel like on a daily basis by sideloading it on my MacBook Pro. Insights follow below.

## Hardware

When my MacBook’s life is getting close to an end, I will start looging for a device to substitute it. Right now, I am inclined to get an awesome Lenovo ThinkPad.

## Switching from MacOS

Some notes concerning stuff I do on MacOS that I need to find an alternative for in Linux:

- [ ] signing documents and filling PDFs
- [ ] keyboard shortcuts to rearrange windows ([Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com 'Rectangle official website'))
- [ ] Automatically switch between light and dark themes, according to the brightness of the environment, using light sensor info ([DarkModeBuddy](https://darkmodebuddy.app 'DarkModeBuddy')
- [ ] remember, store and synchronize WiFi passwords
