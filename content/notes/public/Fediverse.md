## Getting started

### Tutorials and general info

Need some clarifications on how this whole crazy thing works?  
First of all, the good old Wikipedia never lest us down, let’s start from the definition it gives:

> The **fediverse** \[…\] is an ensemble of [federated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federation_(information_technology) 'Federation (information technology)') (i.e. interconnected) servers that are used for [web publishing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_publishing 'Web publishing') (i.e. [social networking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_networking 'Social networking'), [microblogging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microblogging 'Microblogging'), [blogging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blogging 'Blogging'), or [websites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Websites 'Websites')) and file hosting, but which, while independently hosted, can communicate with each other. On different servers (instances), users can create so-called identities. These identities are able to communicate over the boundaries of the instances because the software running on the servers supports one or more [communication protocols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_protocol 'Communication protocol') that follow an [open standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_standard 'Open standard').
