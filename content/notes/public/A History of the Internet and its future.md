p. 15:

> Baran was suggesting combining two previously isolated technologies: computers and communications. Odd as it might appear to readers in the digital age, these were disciplines so mutually distinct that Baran worried his project could fail for lack of staff capable of working in both areas.

Splitting information and communications in small, fragmented <q>packets</q> of data.

page 16:

> Baran’s concept had the same centrifugal character that defines the Internet today. At its most basic, what this book calls the <q>centrifugal</q> approach is to flatten established hierarchies and put power and responsibility at the nodal level so that each node is equal. Baran’s network focused on what he called <q>user to user rather than … centre-to-centre operation</q>.

Even if it was economically extremely convenient (60M$ instead of 2B$ per year), AT&T refused to invest in digital communication technologies.

Scientific advancement and research perceived as the new frontier for modern warfare, at which the Soviets succeeded way more than the US up to the late 50s. RAND comes into play: <q>a degree of intellectual freedom which is … unique</q>.

In February 1958 <abbr title='Advanced Research Projects Agency'>ARPA</abbr> was born:

> It would be a small operation that would issue contracts for research and development to other organizations.

In 1962, Licklider hired by ARPA to focus on command and control of behavioral sciences. Licklider believed that <q>improving the usability of computer systems would lay the foundations for improved command and control</q>.

> At the core of Licklider’s thinking was <u>an emphasis on collaboration</u>. Licklider posited a future scenario in which a researcher at one research centre could find a useful computer resource over the network from a research centre elsewhere. This, in a world of incompatible machines and jealously guarded computing resources, was far-sighted talk indeed.

What in the 60s was strongly and <q>jealously guarded</q>, computing resources, now is abundant. It is now software and algorithms the platforms provided.

> Licklider’s influence was felt further afield through his support of large research programmes in universities that stimulated the early computer studies departments and <u>attracted the new generation of students</u> to the new field.
