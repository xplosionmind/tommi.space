Up to this morning I was completely lost, confused, and bummed up by my total inability of figuring out my [[Thesis]]: I knew the general topics I intended to address, but I was totally clueless about the framework within which I should have placed all of this stuff.

This morning I woke up with a slight but persistent and itchy headache, typical of a light kindahangover. Yet, I grabbed my marker and started to fill the poster-sized blank paper I proudly bought for this purpose.

In a sort of ephiphanic miracle, laying down and visualizing together all of my thoughts, made sudden sense. It is nothing special, it is rather a clich√© and obvious process. Still, the way I lived it made me super pumped.

Of course I still have many question marks, I fear I have too much stuff and I need to get more specific, but it makes me so relieved and committed to have a general scheme, a loose outline of the thesis' flow.
