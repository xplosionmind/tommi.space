description: The tool to read and write on Scambi Festival’s data archive
---
<cite lang='it'>Pino</cite> was a concept for a webapp aimed at handling (hence both reading and writing) [Scambi Festival](https://scambi.org 'Scambi Festival official website')’s database where guests, participants, laboratories, sponsors, ideas, etc. are collected.

Currently, a [Baserow](https://baserow.io 'Baserow official website') instance is hosted on [pino.scambi.org](https://pino.scambi.org 'Pino - Scambi Festival'). It works almost exactly as conceptualized in [the original repository](https://github.com/scambifestival/pino 'Pino repository on GitHub').

Furthermore, I also envisioned to expand the usage of <cite lang='it'>Pino</cite> and turn it into a platform to share event ideas. I get into this in the audio that I originally sent on *Scambi*’s ideas’ group chat:
