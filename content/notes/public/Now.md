What I am doing right now:

## Studying

{% comment %}I am living in [Venice](https://www.comune.venezia.it/ 'Venice institutional website'), Italy, where {% endcomment %}I am a student of [Philosophy, International Studies and Economics](https://unive.it/pise 'PISE course page on UniVe website') at [Ca’ Foscari University](https://unive.it 'Ca’ Foscari University website').

Currently, I am in [[Erasmus à Grenoble|Erasmus]] in [[Grenoble]], France, where I am attending classes both from <a href='https://www.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr' title='Université Grenoble-Alpes' lang='fr' hreflang='fr'>Université Grenoble-Alpes</a> and [Sciences Po](https://www.sciencespo-grenoble.fr 'Sciences Po Grenoble').

## Working on <cite>Scambi Festival</cite>

{% render 'scambi.html', lang: lang %}

## Aministrating <cite>Pan</cite>

<cite>[Pan](https://pan.rent 'Pan social')</cite> is a [[Fediverse]] node I conceived and I maintain together with <cite>APS Oltre</cite>, the same association organizing <cite>Scambi Festival</cite>

## Projects, ideas, and collaborations

In the meanwhile, I am continuing to wander around Italy to take part and/or assist to interesting things that happen. I take note of the most important stuff [here](https://tommi.space/stuff 'Stuff - tommi.space'), and <a href='https://tommi.space/tutto' hreflang='it' title='Tutto quello che ho fatto'>here</a> I log everything (literally anything) I have done.
