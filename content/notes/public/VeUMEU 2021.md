Honorable Presidency and fellow MEPs, the MEP of Portugal Social Democratic Party would like to remind all of you that preserving member states independence and freedom is a core value of the European Union.  
In order to preserve such independence, it is our duty to ensure that no state enforces legislation which is more flexible than in other countries of the Union.  
Therefore, we cannot permit single states to implement legislation which could encourage firms to move their registered offices where the Right to Disconnect is not equally enforced.  
In the long run, the disadvantages for smaller countries that in particular the ID group are so strongly fighting for

we stress that both employers’ and employees’ rights should be guaranteed, and we support an amendment to art. 7 which allows employees’ to sign in to flexible working hours

Amending greater state sovereignty would create great inequality from the economical point of view, in the long run.
