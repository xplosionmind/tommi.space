## Why

[Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com 'Mailchimp') is almost ubiquitous. It even acquired [TinyLetter](https://tinyletter.com/ 'TinyLetter'). It is growing bigger and bigger and it exploits user data. I feel very bad bout having to hand my subscribersâ€™s data to this company.

## listmonk

I am now using [listmonk](https://listmonk.app 'listmonk official website') to manage everything concerning my newsletter. It is self-hosted with [YunoHost](https://yunohost.org 'YunoHost official website') on [[Server|Xplosion Server]].
