## History

<p class='date'><time datetime='2022-08-27T09:50:40+02:00'>Saturday 27 August 2022</time></p>

<cite>Pan</cite> is born as an experimental [[Fediverse]] instance coming out of the [Lab on the topic](https://scambi.org/en/2022/lab/6 'Fediverse: Social Network Umani') during [Scambi Festival 2022](https://scambi.org/2022 'Scambi Festival’s II edition').

The server [social.scambi.org](https://web.archive.org/https://social.scambi.org 'Snapshot of social.scambi.org') is hosted on is owned and maintained by by [<cite lang='it'>APS Oltre</cite>](https://manuale.scambi.org/en/association 'About APS Oltre'), the same association organizing the festival.

<p class='date'><time datetime='2022-11-12T10:06:19+01:00'>Saturday 12 November 2022</time></p>

Out of my desire to create a more stable, participated and tight community of people, I decided to re-build this instance with more awareness and reasoning.

I started this endeavor by looking for [the right domain](#Name).

<p class='date'><time datetime='2022-11-13T11:04:13+01:00'>Sunday 13 November 2022</time></p>

I am getting in touch with other instances’ admins [to ask for tips and advices](#Questions).

I am starting from [Darius Kazemi](https://tinysubversions.com 'Darius Kazemi’s personal website'), who is not only the admin of the wonderful [friend.camp](https://friend.camp/about 'About friend.camp'), but also the author of what I would define [the bible of Fediverse communities](https://runyourown.social 'How to run a small social network site for your friends').

I would like to keep the instance in the hands of an association (thus <cite lang='it'>APS Oltre</cite>), rather than me, since I would like the very legal basis of our community to be a collective rather than individual effort. Nevertheless, I believe that even though Pan is necessarily linked to Scambi Festival, <u>there should not be any co-dependence between the two projects</u>: one thing is carrying on with a festival, another is managing an online community.

## Name

While looking for affordable domains with `pan.*`, I stumbled upon `pan.rent`, and it immediately clicked. <q>Pan</q>, the original name, matched with <q>rent</q> would make a great homage to my beloved <cite>[[Rent]]</cite>!

![[Rent#Everything is rent!]]

<q>Pan</q> means <q>everything</q>, therefore <cite>Pan</cite>’s domain would be a semi-quote from the musical lyrics. Furthermore, the instance’s values would perfectly match the spirit of the festival.

## Values

<div class='yellow box'>
	The following points are just some ideas, definitely not the final values of <cite>Pan</cite>
</div>

- People on this server are less than 30 years old. We do not discriminate older people, but we would like to form a community with fresh and dynamic young souls.
- no bias and no discrimination towards anyone’s personal qualities

## Questions

- What about using [Mastodon Glitch Edition](https://glitch-soc.github.io/docs 'Mastodon Glitch Edition documentation')?
- Asking 1€/month (12€/year at subscription time) for each user?
- Involving people who already know me or each other, or making a sort of open call, then making interviews to interested people?
