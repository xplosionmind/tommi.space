description: A social network based on personal and historical events
aliases: Timeline development, Timeline, Aby
redirect_from: [/timeline/]

Who I am is also, or mostly, defined by the events which marked my life even before my birth:  
*Zig* is a social network where people share dates which are significant to them. It is named in honor of [Zigmunt Bauman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zigmunt_Bauman 'Zigmunt Bauman on Wikipedia'), great historian and sociologist.

A profile is made by the important milestones in both his/her life and in history in general. To put it briefly and simply, <u><cite>Zig</cite> is a *social medium* </u>

*Zig* should:
- share dates of both historical and personal events
- integrate with [ActivityPub](https://activitypub.rocks 'ActivityPub') and therefore join the [Fediverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse '“Fediverse„ on Wikipedia')
- collect other 
- integrate with [[Nolan]], and be its “public front-end”

## mine

As my personal kind-of timeline, I am currently using a combo of different solutions that I dream about somehow integrating together, one day:

- Within [Obsidian], I track notes creation and modification dates thanks to the awesome [*Chronology* plugin](https://github.com/Canna71/obsidian-chronology 'obsidian-chronology’s source code on GitHub')
- In tommi.space, I track changes through [a super-minimal changelog]({{ site.issues }}/50)

## Tools

- [TimelineJS](https://timeline.knightlab.com 'TimelineJS')
- [d3](https://github.com/d3/d3 'd3 repository on GitHub')

## Examples

Add a timeline like [Jeremy Gordon's](https://jgordon.io "Jeremy Gordon") or [jack.works](https://web.archive.org/web/20200513054829/http://jack.works/)
	- [CSS Timelines examples](https://freefrontend.com/css-timelines/ "65 CSS Timelines")
	- more promising ones:
		- https://codepen.io/ArnaudBalland/pen/rLeQgd/ (uses JavaScript)
		- https://codepen.io/triss90/pen/GqRKeW/
		- https://codepen.io/chriswrightdesign/pen/XJzNBN/, the prettier one (it has no dedicated space to dates)
		- https://codepen.io/P233/pen/lGewF/
		- https://codepen.io/rprajapatii/pen/AXoWyd (animations with JavaScript)
		- https://codepen.io/NilsWe/pen/FemfK
		- https://codepen.io/allisonching/pen/XeLjGd (simple minimal horizontal)

## Naming

Alternative name ideas:

- *Aby*, in honor of [[Aby Warburg]] (see [*Mnemosyne*](https://tommi.space/mnemosyne '“Mnemosyne„ article on tommi.space'))
