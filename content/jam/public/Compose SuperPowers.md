Compose SuperPowers (abbreviated CSP) my idea of a Linux software aimed at helping to type with the Compose Key (abbr `CK`) and the Super Key (abbr `SK`).

When pressing on `CK` or `SK` while typing, CSP makes appear on the screen a beautifully designed list of all the possible typing options, that are fine-tuned gradually as more keys are typed. Of course, at the beginning the potential combinations are plenty, therefore CSP could show the most frequent or recent typing combinations (or, even better, the *least* recent: people remember well what they use often, but they forget what they use rarely. This is what CSP exists for).
