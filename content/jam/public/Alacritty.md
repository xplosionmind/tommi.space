Since I am planning to [[Switch to Linux]], I am looking for a great terminal emulator to replace the awesome [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com 'iTerm2'), which is limited to MacOS. I found Alacritty to be a great candidate and I am testing it.

## Changing the font

Follow the article <cite>[Change Font in Alacritty](https://www.behova.net/fonts-in-alacritty 'Change Font in Alacritty | Behova.net')</cite>, but create the config file from scratch, since on MacOS I could not find any example.
