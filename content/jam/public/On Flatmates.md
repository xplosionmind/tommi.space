You realize the vital quintessential spiritual emotional comical value of a flatmate only when you miss them.

Be them crappy and dirty, reliable and overattentive, loud, insensitive, open, dumb, they are an overly undervalued component of the life of a person. Flatmates: a set of mysterious and intriguing people who is always taken for granted and in some cases more than others despised because of some behavior or characteristic.

Truth is that they are the people you end up spending the most time with, either while in separate rooms and barely talking, or while sharing all of your most profound feelings.

Even if not spending much time actually *together*, you still share the most important place of all: *home*. Such kind of relationship goes deep, regardless of our intentions and of our going along.
