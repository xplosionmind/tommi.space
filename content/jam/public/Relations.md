Relations, especially if human, are hard but wonderful; they are what makes life great and worth living. I am collecting here thoughts and insights about this.

About the importance of reciprocal openness and explicitness concerning relationship feelings:

### Collective reciprocal feelings sharing

> Feelings checkin is a [Recurse Center](https://recurse.com/ 'Recurse Center') tradition, which is designed to give people a space to share and process their feelings. \[…\] It’s really easy to do, so if you would value having a space to process your emotions, you too can start a feelings checkin group!
> Feelings checkin is a weekly event, usually with somewhere from 3 to 10 people who attend. It’s a space to reflect on the feelings you’ve had over the past week. It’s held in a private, hopefully comfy room.
