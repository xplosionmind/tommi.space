## Embracing the Berlin life

After moving to Berlin for my internship, quite a lot of unprecedented things crashed down on me. Above them all, living in a really big city, whose language I don’t speak, a place with a very different soul, temperature, and temperament with respect to the places I have lived before.

Settling in and discovering this fascinating conundrum of life is taking up pretty much all of the time I am not working.

Mostly threading my way into whimsical *raves*, meeting people, strolling around, getting lost, being found, then lost again into the thundering darkness of this unique city.

## Writing

I told myself that I would commit to carve out some time to focus on comprehensively revising [[Thesis|my bachelor’s thesis]] to make into a book. I am not doing it as much as I wanted, but I am keeping the mindset.

## <cite>Pan</cite>

<cite>[Pan](https://pan.rent 'Pan social')</cite> is a [[Fediverse]] node I conceived and I maintain together with <cite>APS Oltre</cite>, the same association organizing [<cite>Scambi Festival</cite>](https://scambi.org/en)
