## Free Software Foundation Europe

I am living in **Berlin**, where I am working at the [<abbr title='Free Software Foundation Europe'>FSFE</abbr>](https://fsfe.org) as an intern.

## <cite>Pan</cite>

<cite>[Pan](https://pan.rent 'Pan social')</cite> is a [[Fediverse]] node I conceived and I maintain together with <cite>APS Oltre</cite>, the same association organizing [<cite>Scambi Festival</cite>](https://scambi.org/en)

## Projects, ideas, and collaborations

I take note of the most important stuff [here](https://tommi.space/stuff 'Stuff - tommi.space'), and <a href='https://tommi.space/tutto' hreflang='it' title='Tutto quello che ho fatto'>here</a> I log everything (literally anything) I have done.
