Chi sono io? Tolta la [Tomminess](Tomminess.md), tolto tutto ciò che faccio e quello di cui parlo, rimossa ogni relazione con l’esterno, più *profondamente* ed essenzialmente, chi sono ***io***?

	<p>About identity, <a href='https://sickinternet.me/'>Mac</a> <time>once</time> texted me:</p>
	<blockquote>
		<ol>
			<li>A self-identity is sooo 2015! Kill your ego! You are a multiple of selves that you don’t need to fully recognize!</li>
			<li>I feel like we’re living in an era where stability is just a dream :)))) Balance is good to consider but doesn’t have to be a precondition for trying out opportunities</li>
		</ol>
		<p>It’s all tough but we just need lots of unconditional love from friends too to keep going, so we don’t have to overthink so much!</p>
