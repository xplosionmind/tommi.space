While reading [A History of the Internet and the digital future](A%20History%20of%20the%20Internet%20and%20the%20digital%20future.md) for [my bachelorâ€™s thesis](Computer%20Sciences%20Are%20Social%20Sciences.md), I got the idea that it would be incredibly cool to reinvent browsers as they were in the early days of the World Wide Web: software that not limited to browsing the web, but actively enabling and empowering anyone to create a basic website. Something like an universal profile and identity page, not necessarily a personal website, not a social media profile.
