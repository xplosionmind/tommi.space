## Introduction and explanation

As my main project for [my guest residency](/now/#2025-09-24) at [Foundation B.a.d](https://www.foundationbad.nl/), I want to host a series of screenings of films about **precariousness**, **homelessness**, **gentrification**, the Netherlands’ **housing crisis**, and related topics, together with my fellow resident [Ariela Bergman](https://artoffice.info/kunstenaar/ariela-bergman/ 'Ariela Bergman on ArtOffice.info').

By using [this shared link](https://cloud.tommi.space/s/2fQs62fYiitJqkF 'B.a.d Rent – cloud.tommi.space'), you can edit this page and contribute the list of proposals, so that we can think of a provisional plan for the screenings + post-movie discussions to be held at Foundation B.a.d, in Tallingstraat 5, Rotterdam.

## Titles proposals

Please, add any titles of films you would like to suggest, followed by `~ your name`.
