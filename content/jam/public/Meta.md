I put a lot of care and attention to details in this website‚Äîprobably too much. Thus, I thought it would be worth sharing my decisions about implementations and features in a log, so that the overall design philosophy of tommi.space is summarized in one place and I can keep track of my thoughts.

## Current information

Here are some general current information about tommi.space. However, in the footer of every page you can find more details about that specific page.

## Version 3 ü´£

As opposed to [version 2](#version-2), that mainly signified a change in perspective and left most of the code as it was, this version marks <u>strong changes at the technical level</u>.

To share the modifications applied I should be pointing to the source code‚Äôs changelog, but I am so terrible at committing to git regularly that in the end all that has changed for version 3 is grouped in *one* commit üò¨. Therefore, I am listing the most notable reworkings manually, following my memory of what I have inconsistently edited in the past eight months‚Äîas I have been working on this on and off since May 2024.

- The most remarkable transformation is the migration to the mighty [Eleventy version 3](https://www.11ty.dev/blog/eleventy-v3/ '‚ÄúEleventy v3.0.0 is now available!‚Äù in Eleventy‚Äôs blog'), which forced me to better understand the way Eleventy and JavaScript work, as I transitioned the whole project to <abbr title='ECMAScript Modules'>ESM</abbr>.
	- I updated the [eleventy-img plugin](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/image/ 'Image Plugin ‚Äì 11ty Docs'), finally replacing Liquid‚Äôs {% raw %}`{% img %}`{% endraw %} shortcodes with regular `<img>` HTML tags.
	- Since [eleventy-sass](https://github.com/kentaroi/eleventy-sass 'kentaroi/eleventy-sass on GitHub') still [does not support ESM](https://github.com/kentaroi/eleventy-sass/issues/33 'Issue #33 for kentaroi/eleventy-sass on GitHub'), I decided to remove dependence from a plugin to compile Sass, and it is done in a parallel, independent process instead.
	- Taking advantage of the [InputPath to URL plugin](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/inputpath-to-url/ 'InputPath to URL ‚Äì 11ty Docs'), I removed the [markdown-it-wikilinks](https://www.npmjs.com/package/markdown-it-wikilinks 'markdown-it-wikilinks by jsepia ‚Äì NPM') extension, so that now internal links can be regular and interoperable Markdown links.
- I completely refactored the CSS, adopting the [CUBE methodology](https://cube.fyi/ 'Composition Utility Block Exception') (I still have to refine this, though), and basing the whole layout on [CSS Grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid 'grid CSS Reference on MDN').
- I completely refactored the code generating this website‚Äôs [RSS feeds](/index.xml 'tommi.space‚Äôs main Stream'), and I styled their pages, inspired by [Simone Silvestroni‚Äôs post](https://minutestomidnight.co.uk/blog/build-a-human-readable-rss-with-jekyll/ 'A human-readable RSS feed with Jekyll ‚Äì Minutes to Midnight')
- After [a brief conversation with friends](content/jam/public/Editing%20tommi.space.md '‚ÄúEditing tommi.space‚Äù'), I decided to adopt a more radical approach with respect to old content I changed my mind about, or I would not want to share anymore, by simply **removing it**.
- I finally figured out how to meddle with the data cascade using JavaScript, and the code is now a bit leaner, simpler, more efficient, and more organized.
- I moved the automatically generated templates (with no content of their own) to the `stuff` directory, to declutter the `content` directory, and follow a clearer structure‚Äîeven though the source code is still a nightmare to navigate ü§Ø.
- At last, I created the first prototype of the [<cite>Activities</cite> page](/activities/), with advanced search and filtering functionality, that I plan to extend to the whole website, in addition to the existing [search page](/search/).
- Probably, a few more things that I forgot.

## Version 2!

**I completely rethought tommi.space**. I explain what marks this new version in [a dedicated post](content/zibaldone/2023-10-31-Rethinking-my-digital-space.md 'Rethinking tommi.space').

The major change marking this new version is philosophical, but I changed a few nice technicalities, too.

## Heading font

I love Inter, but using it everywhere is becoming quite boring. I have been thinking about choosing a cool whimsical font to use in headings for a while.

I chose to use <cite>[Permanent Marker](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/permanent-marker 'Permanent Marker on FontSquirrel')</cite> since it wonderfully reflects the work-in-progress mood of the website.

<p class='date'><time datetime='2023-10-16T14:00:00+02:00'>October 16<sup>th</sup> 2023</time></p>

## Remove the share section

As with the analytics, I realized that the share section is quite useless, and the page weight and performance vs utility ratio is not worth it. Removed that, too! How liberating it is to just strip away all extra stuff!

<p class='date'><time datetime='2023-10-17T16:53:00+02:00'>October 17<sup>th</sup> 2023</time></p>

## Dropping Gemini

I did not log it here, but in late 2022 [I set up a Gemini capsule for tommi.space](tommi.space%20Gemini%20capsule.md), meaning a modified, minimalist version of this website was made available via the [Gemini protocol](https://geminiprotocol.net 'Gemini protocol in the standard web'). I developed [a script to build and deploy the capsule](https://github.com/xplosionmind/scripts/tree/main/titan 'Titan, the script that launches tommi.space in the Geminispace'), and I configured [a Gemini server](https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/gemserv_ynh 'gemserv YunoHost package') in [YunoHost](https://yunohost.org) to publish it.

As time passed by, something in the workflow broke, and I did not have enough time to fix it. This made me realize that <u>geek stuff such as Gemini should be fun experiments rather than growing maintenance burden of an amateur self-hoster</u> like me.

I do not exclude to bring the capsule back to life if I feel like it, but I want to keep things light and joyful. Not thinking about it for a while.

<p class='date'><time datetime='2023-10-14T23:00:00+02:00'>October 14<sup>th</sup> 2023</time></p>

## No analytics!

I realized that I do not actually need analytics on this website. I uninstalled [umami](https://umami.is 'umami official website') and I removed any client-side tracking. I did so for multiple reasons:

- I rarely checked the data
- Data was not reliable, since [visits.tommi.space is now listed in the easylist blocklist](https://github.com/easylist/easylist/issues/15069 '‚ÄúALLOW *.tommi.space / remove visits.tommi.space from the list‚Äù issue in easylist repository on GitHub'). All the people using ad blockers did not appear at all in the stats.
- Loading the analytics script took the website ~700ms longer to fully load.
- I should learn to analyze server access logs, and I could use [server-side analytics](https://plausible.io/blog/server-log-analysis 'Client side vs server side analytics: What‚Äôs the gap in data? | Plausible blog')
- In the end, do I really care about how many people visit this crazy place? I do not need to see numbers, but to get feedback, create actual, direct, interactions!

<p class='date'><time datetime='2023-04-05T00:00:00+01:00'>April 5<sup>th</sup> 2023</time></p>

## Search

Finally, after three years since rewriting this website from scratch, I found [Pagefind](https://pagefind.app 'Pagefind') to be <u>the perfect search solution</u>, both in terms of ease of use and performance.

<p class='date'><time datetime='2022-12-01T10:14:49+01:00'>Thursday, December 1<sup>st</sup> 2022</time></p>

## Self-hosting

By migrating [Nebuchadnezzar](Nebuchadnezzar.md) to a slightly more performant machine, I ended up messing up some configurations, and I also realized that my website publishing workflow was not really independent and stable. Therefore, I decided it was time to self host tommi.space.

[More details in the dedicated page](Self-hosting%20tommi.space.md).

<p class='date'><time datetime='2022-06-19T23:04:30+02:00'>Sunday, June 19<sup>th</sup> 2022</time></p>

## Issue tracking

Up to now, anything concerning website ideas and development was listed quite randomly on the website development page. My intention was to keep everything portable and within <cite>[The Jam](https://tommi.space/jam 'The Jam ‚Äî tommi.space')</cite>. Nevertheless, tracking both bugs, feature ideas and stuff to do with services dedicated to that is easier, simpler, and much more integrated with the development environment and workflow that git provides.

I am now [using GitHub for issue tracking](https://github.com/xplosionmind/tommi.space/issues 'tommi.space issues on GitHub'), even though the repository is currently being hosted on [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/tommi/tommi.space 'tommi.space repository on Codeberg').

<p class='date'><time datetime='2022-04-21T06:14:30+02:00'>Thursday, April 21<sup>st</sup> 2022</time></p>

## Hosting

Since the beginning, [Netlify](https://netlify.com 'Netlify') has been where tommi.space is hosted. It has to be noted, though, that Netlify is no champion of openness, free software, or sustainable infrastructure, hence not a service whose values I completely share. Nevertheless, it is awesome, since at the same time it both has more than what I need, and it is fairly simple. It hurts to say it, but I love it and I am sticking with it, since it really makes much of the work easier.

All of the relatively big files on the website (such as images and podcast audios) are hosted on [Storj](https://storj.io 'Storj'), and through a couple of tricks they are seamlessly served through Netlify. Storj too has its red flags, since it is based on the blockchain and I am still quite skeptical concerning all of this stuff. But, again, it wonderfully does the work, at least until [Cubbit](https://cubbit.io 'Cubbit') won‚Äôt get around static hosting, as Stefano, its CEO, anticipated to me someday it will.

## Analytics

The sole aspect I am interested in is knowing how many people visit my website, specifically which pages.

Being Google Analytics definitely out of consideration, finding a simple, free, light (and hosted) analytics service is not simple.

- [counter.dev](https://counter.dev 'Counter') is the most clever, the lightest, and among the most beautiful analytics software I have ever seen. Unfortunately, it has some big problems that make its numbers not remotely corresponding to reality, and its developers do not plan to fix them anytime soon.
- [Matomo](https://matomo.org 'Matomo') is the go-to Google Analytics alternative, but, as such, it has many features that I do not need and that make it quite heavy.
- [Plausible](https://plausible.io 'Plausible Analytics') is the analytics service I have been using in the last two years, even though it does not feel 100% right, even if it nicely does the work I require. Probably, it is because it costs me a little more than 30‚Ç¨ a year, and I would like to avoid such expense.

Of course, I prefer to self-host analytics, but as of right now Matomo is the only analytics platform packaged for YunoHost (the OS I am using on [Xplosion Server](Nebuchadnezzar.md)). As soon as any light analytics software will get packaged for YunoHost, I will switch to it.

## Migrating from GitHub to Codeberg

I love community-driven stuff, and I praise [Codeberg values](https://docs.codeberg.org/getting-started/what-is-codeberg/#our-mission '‚ÄúOur mission‚Äù in Codeberg documentation'). Furthermore, there is all of that stuff that is not good about GitHub, so I moved.

## New repository

I never gave too much attention to the size of the repository of tommi.space, until it clearly huge, with a size of ~1GB. I took advantage of the switch to Eleventy to start a new repository from scratch. The obsolete Jekyll-based website is on GitHub at [old.tommi.space](https://github.com/xplosionmind/old.tommi.space 'old.tommi.space on GitHub')

## Switching to Eleventy

My switching from [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com 'Jekyll official website') to [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev 'Eleventy‚Äôs official website') is one of those things that was not strictly necessary, yet I kept thinking about it every time I coded something, even minimal, on Jekyll. So I switched. It has been very stressful and intense, but I am now thoroughly proud of the fundamental structure of my website, even if it still lacks some features it had with Jekyll.

There are plenty of step-by-step guides to switch from Jekyll to Eleventy. Even though tutorials have been of little use for me, since tommi.space is heavily customized and tailored, I saved (and I am still continuing to save) insightful articles about Eleventy.

Equally, there are a ton of blog posts comparing the two static site generators, but, again, I am just interested in noting my personal reasons.
- Eleventy now has [around three full time development funding](https://www.11ty.dev/blog/eleventy-oss/ 'Full Time Open Source Development for Eleventy, sponsored by Netlify') working on it. [Jekyll is arguably dying](https://talk.jekyllrb.com/t/is-the-jekyll-project-dead/6820 '‚ÄúIs the Jekyll project dead?‚Äù thread on Jekyll forum'). The only consequence I am interested in is **support**: even after posting the most absurd or tricky question on the [Eleventy discussions](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy/discussions 'GitHub Discussions on Eleventy repository'), I get an answer in less than 40 hours. On the Jekyll forum, I often relied only on the help of [Michael Currin](https://talk.jekyllrb.com/u/michaelcurrin/ 'Michael Currin‚Äôs profile on Jekyll‚Äôs forum'), who to my eyes quickly became some sort of divinity (as [Peter DeHaan](https://github.com/pdehaan 'Peter deHaan GitHub profile') is for help with Eleventy), but I could never get 100% of what I was looking for.
- I have no intention to start coding as my main activity. Still, it is undeniable that the more coding skills, the better it is on this crazy planet in the 21<sup>st</sup> century. After such premise, it goes without saying that a <abbr title='Static Site Generator'>SSG</abbr> built with JavaScript (such as Eleventy) is to be preferred over one that uses Ruby (such as Jekyll).
- A relevant consequence of the point above is that while with Jekyll I was completely dependent on (and blocked by) plugins and their developers, I now have a little (yet growing) possibility to <u>code some simple features myself</u>, since I am slooooowly learning its basics.
- I do not care much about **build time**, but when on Jekyll it surpassed the 120 seconds, it started to become incredibly itchy and time-consuming to do anything. Eleventy crashed that time down to less than 30 seconds. Considering the average of build times, it still is quite a lot, but I have no time to spend in build speed optimization. It is fine like this.
- It is not a logical not objective argument, but while building Jekyll I continuously got **many warnings** and frequent errors too, even without changing anything‚Äîmainly, I believe the main reason were outdated dependencies. I could not stand it anymore.

<p class='date'><time datetime='2021-01-09'>9<sup>th</sup> January 2021</time></p>

## Sidenotes

Sidenotes are awesome, and after taking a look at [Koos Loijesteijn post](https://www.kooslooijesteijn.net/blog/sidenotes-without-js 'Sidenotes without JavaScript') about them, I figured it would be great to implement them on here, too.

I decided not to, for now, for three main reasons:
1. They are impossible to be implemented in Markdown, they need **a lot** of HTML and I don‚Äôt have the skills for making a Jekyll plugin to transform footnotes in sidenotes (but it may be a great idea to create one)
2. I could easily create an {% raw %}`{% render sidenotes.html %}`{% endraw %} where I could pass as arguments both the note content and the word linked to it, but it wouldn‚Äôt satisfy me for two reasons:
	1. In the case of printing, it would be a great mess.
	2. On other readers or Markdown parsers outside of Jekyll I‚Äôd have a massive chunk of unrendered ugly text
3. Considered the reasons above, <u>it‚Äôs not worth it</u>. I use footnotes very few times (even though I massively over-use parentheses (as I am doing right now)) and with the lovely arrow[^1] automatically created, it‚Äôs painless to use them.

### Algolia

It is not the best solution in terms of speed and dependance, but it is still valid temporarily. Search functionality is very useful, so it is a trade-off I am willing to accept‚Äîtemporarily).

Following [these instructions](https://algolia.com/doc/tools/crawler/netlify-plugin/quick-start 'Quickstart for Using Algolia on Netlify ') the setup is quite simple. What is annoying and long to effectively customize is [the front-end CSS](https://github.com/algolia/autocomplete/blob/next/packages/autocomplete-theme-classic/src/theme.scss 'SCSS source for Algolia‚Äôs Autocomplete front-end, on GitHub'), which I eventually decided would be simple to [write from scratch](https://github.com/xplosionmind/old.tommi.space/blob/257e2fc7660fd7f878404ab855695cc67445a6c7/_sass/_search.scss 'My SCSS partial for Algolia front-end styling') by myself.

## Typography and layout

Even though I love [Typography](Typography.md), I am never fully convinced about this website layout and design. My concern is not much about coloring, and typesetting, but about layouting, spacing and positioning. I am trying to understand the core of how layouting works by reading at a tremendously slow pace Richard Rutter‚Äôs <cite>[Web Typography](Web%20Typography.md)</cite>.

I will be noting below my doubts and, if solved, my conclusions.

<ul>
	{%- for p in collections.all -%}
		{%- if p.data.todo -%}
			<li><a href='{{ p.url }}' title='{{ p.data.title }}'>{{ p.data.title }}</a>:
				<ul>
					{%- for task in p.data.todo -%}
						<li>{{ task | markdownify }}</li>
					{%- endfor -%}
				</ul>
			</li>
		{%- endif -%}
	{%- endfor -%}
</ul>
