description: Too Much Information, an acronym which perfectly defines my tomminess
---
Wikitionary entry for [too much information](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/too_much_information '“too much information” on Wikitionary'):

> An expression indicating that someone has revealed information that is too personal and made the listener or reader uncomfortable.

During a wonderful chill evening at Zattere with my friends, I met Simone, the flatmate of my friend and fellow PISEr Chiara. He introduced me to a three letters acronym which I decided to make **my** acronym since the very moment I heard it for the first time: ==<abbr title='Too Much Information'><strong>TMI</strong></abbr>==, which stands for *Too Much Information*.

TMI is the pure essence of [Tomminess](Tomminess.md), both because of its meaning, which is the constant mood of my life, and because its letters closely resemble my name. Furthermore, it is short and it makes it [a perfect domain name](https://shop.gandi.net/en/domain/suggest?search=tmi 'Search tmi.\* domains on Gandi') to keep in consideration for the future.

I will forever be grateful to Simone for making me discover such a wonderful acronym which I will use more and more in the future.

## Trust My Instinct

Getting ready for the first pseudo-DJ set of my life, I was testing out the equipment in <cite>Casa R19</cite>, where I would’ve performed. In the meanwhile, my flatmate Ebba was rehearsing for her show with his friend.

I forgot the name of the friend, but we chatted for a while and I found out he DJs too, and he gave me a few basic tips (it was the first time I talked about DJing techniques to someone). Among the things he told me, <q>trust your instincts</q>, he said.

Only some hours later it flashed in my mind: TMI could mean <q>Trust My Instinct</q>, too.
