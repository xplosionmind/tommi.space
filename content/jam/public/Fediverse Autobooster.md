Not having using algorithms, it is terribly easy to miss relevant posts in the Fediverse, unless people choose to enable notifications for individual specific accounts.

I’d like to create a tool that <u>automatically and recursively boosts a selected post</u> on the Fediverse, over an arbitrary time span.

In ethical terms, I do not think this is something nice, because it would mean spamming and bloating other people’s timeline without their consent. Nevertheless, conceiving and developing a tool like this might be a good opportunity to exercise my limited coding skills, and then I can figure out what to do with it.
