Given the rampant and prolonged [housing crisis in the Netherlands](https://www.theguardian.com/news/article/2024/may/06/netherlands-amsterdam-next-level-housing-crisis 'â€˜Everythingâ€™s just â€¦ on holdâ€™: the Netherlandsâ€™ next-level housing crisis'), and an unstable right-wing government unable to effectively address the issue, it becomes necessary to take the matter into our own hands and build cooperative, human, cultural solutions from below.

Be it squatting, cooperative housing, or any more specific structure, itâ€™s evident that actually useful solutions occur mostly outside the institutional framework.

Inspired by <cite>[Rent](Rent.md)</cite> (1996), the absolute masterpiece by Jonathan Larson, itâ€™s my intention to investigate the relationship between housing, arts, culture, and anarchist political practice.

What are the practices and devices non-profit cultural organizations take advantage of to survive the ongoing funding crisis for the third sector? Who are the individuals and collectives fighting the housing crisis in the front line in the Netherlands?
