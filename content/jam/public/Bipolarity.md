Oddly enough, the first time I actually observed an example of pathological bipolarity was in [the third episode of the first season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Love_(TV_series)#ep3 '“Modern Love” S01E03 on Wikipedia') of <cite>[Modern Love](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Love_(TV_series) '“Modern Love” on Wikipedia')</cite>.

Understanding this concept is very related to my quest to determine my [identity](Identità.md).
