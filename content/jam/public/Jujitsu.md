description: Learning Jujitsu (jj), an interesting new generation git-compatible VCS.
permalink: /jj/

[Jujitsu](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/ 'Jujitsu’s homepage') (`jj`) is <q>a Git-compatible VCS that is both simple and powerful</q>. I am very curious about it, and I would never bother learning more about another VCS if it was not compatible with Git. Since it is, it looks very promising and I am super interested in diving deeper and start using it in some projects.

I am reading the introduction to the project from [Steve Klabnik’s Jujutsu Tutorial](https://steveklabnik.github.io/jujutsu-tutorial/).
