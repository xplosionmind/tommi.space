## What

A common misconception is the belief that <q>the cloud</q> (a.k.a. the Internet) is an abstract and remote entity, with no tangible ties to the real world. However, as [the <abbr title='Free Software Foundation Europe'>FSFE</abbr>’s catchphrase](https://fsfe.org/contribute/spreadtheword.html#nocloud-sticker-bw) cleverly puts it, <q cite='https://fsfe.org/contribute/spreadtheword.html#nocloud-sticker-bw'>there is NO CLOUD, just other people’s computers</q>. This understanding is not limited to ethics and privacy considerations: it also carries a significant material weight. The Internet is literally *made up* of computers that are perpetually switched on and connected to the net (a.k.a. servers).

What does this mean, and what does this have to do with the environmental impact of this website?

Like any other website, tommi.space is hosted on a server. In particular, its home is <cite>[[Nebuchadnezzar]]</cite>, my <abbr title='Virtual Private Server'>VPS</abbr> located in Dusseldorf. I ([Tommi](https://tommi.space/home#about 'About Tommi')) pay a fee to rent the VPS because [Contabo](https://contabo.com), the company that owns it, takes care of its maintenance and of the bill for the electricity it consumes.

By consuming electricity, this website has an environmental impact too.

I used <cite><a href='https://www.websitecarbon.com/website/tommi-space-home/' title='Sustainability report for “tommi.space/home”'>Website Carbon Calculator</a></cite> and <cite><a href='https://ecograder.com/report/eh2v0DedUhTQLxvWYaxjNXBp' title='Sustainability report for “tommi.space/home”'>Ecograder</a></cite> to measure the environmental impact of tommi.space. These two tools determine how polluting loading a page is by estimating the amount CO<sub>2</sub> emissions it causes. On their websites there are detailed explanations of the process and the evaluation criteria.

## Why

The sustainability score of my website is **B**. I am displaying it in the footer of every page of this website—scroll to the bottom to see it.

<div id='wcb' class='carbonbadge'></div>
<script src='https://unpkg.com/website-carbon-badges@1.1.3/b.min.js' defer></script>

- For the sake of **transparency**: I attribute great value to [exposing the invisible](https://tacticaltech.org/projects/exposing-the-invisible/ '“Exposing the Invisible” on Tactical Tech’s website'), especially in the digital domain; it is useful for many purposes, research and learning to name the two that come to mind.
- To highlight that this website and the Internet as a whole *do contribute* to the pollution of planet Earth.
- To prove the value of simple static websites: even if not great, the B score is still way better than **E-**, the average score of the webpages served on planet Earth!
- The responsibility is not merely individual (see below)!

## Why not

Why doesn’t tommi.space have the best possible score (A+)?

- The energy <cite>[[Nebuchadnezzar]]</cite> runs on does not come from renewable sources. “Sustainable” VPSs with the same specifications are too costly for me right now.
- Part of the score is given by making the code better, to make each web page lighter and more efficient. There is only so much I can improve with my limited technical skills.

### The responsibility is not merely individual

I am strongly against the psychological terrorism blaming individuals for any non-sustainable behavior. Solutions to the climate crisis can only be effective if enacted using a global and collective perspective. This should start from strong political actions against the richest, not by priding ourselves because we have a website with an **A+** score.

Even though I condemn weighting on the conscience of a single person for not being <q>green</q> enough, I do value, admire, and radical actions aimed at promoting truly sustainable policies and at banning fossil fuel.

I prefer investing my time, resources, and efforts in connecting, organizing, and discussing about this topic, rather than to get a better sustainability score for my personal website.
