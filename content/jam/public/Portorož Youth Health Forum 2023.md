## Final speech

**Discomfort**, how to address this odd and difficult to explain feeling

Wondering what was the reason of all that rumbling in my belly and weird pounding in my chest

Why a four stars hotel and not a youth hostel or a school gym, all together in sleeping bags?

The problem is not who is not in the room or who is there, but rather how *we* got here.

**priviledge**

What should we do? I would start by acknowledging that the vast majority of the problems we brought forward does not tackle the fundamental problems, but rather attempts to put patches to a sinking boat.

the average wealth of the world might have grown, but the difference among the poorest and the richest widened terribly.

## Absurd affirmations

- <q>not all inequalities are bad</q>
- <q>rich people should not exist</q> <q>why not? You would be violating a right</q>
- alcool should cost more to reduce consumption
