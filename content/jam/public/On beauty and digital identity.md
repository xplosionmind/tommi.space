description: Thinking about the concept of beauty intertwined with the representation of a digital identity. What is *my* digital identity?

Building a creative, yet neat and structured virtual personality is not simple, because properly setting the nuanced variations at its core represents the very geniality of its  
creative component.

I believe the key representation of such technical creative exploit to be **domain names**. The efficacy, the power, the beauty, the magic of finding the perfect domain name is paramount. I am glad and proud when I go through the [[Domains|domains]] I conceived: tommi.space, pan.rent, sconnesso.link… don’t they have a particular *beauty*? What defines such beauty? Where does it come from?

Beauty in digital terms is minimal poetry, essential burst of craft and inventiveness.

Secondly, and a superset of domain creativity, are [[Email addresses|email addresses]].
