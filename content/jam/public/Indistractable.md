These are my notes on <cite><a href='https://www.nirandfar.com/indistractable'>Indistractable</a></cite> by [Nir Eyal](https://www.nirandfar.com/about-nir-eyal "About page on Nir Eyal official website"). The first few annotations and quotes come from the first time I read the book (and stopped after 30 pages, as always) around December 2020.

## First read

> Removing online technology didn’t work. I’d just replace one distraction with another.

p.7

From Plato’s <cite><a href='https://classics.mit.edu/Plato/phaedrus.html'>Phaedrus</a></cite>: Socrates points out that the written word <q>forgetfulness in the learners’ soul</q>

The first, main and primary cause of distraction is not the more immediate one, the one intuitively linked to our activity, but it’s much deeper, and it lies in our response:
> Distraction, it turns out, isn’t about the distraction itself; rather, it’s about how we respond to it.

p.25

> distraction is always an unhealthy escape from reality.

p.26

> without dealing with the discomfort of driving the desire for escape, we’ll continue to resort to one distraction or another.
>
> *Only by understanding our pain can we begin to control it and find better ways to deal with negative urges.*

Therefore, dealing with distractions starts from dealing with the internal cause prior to the contingent events. We need to narrow it down to internal triggers which start everything.  
Without doing so we’d be going from one distraction to another Blaise Pascal.

p.27

The argument of discomfort and uneasiness regardless of luck and overall welfare and wellness: <q>why are we perpetually restless and unsatisfied?</q>

## Second read

As I am much more opinionated and, to some extent, radical with respect to the first time I have started this book, the approach will be much less naïve and more critical. I cannot in good conscience really appreciate the value of this book, if right at page 2 there is **a *major* red flag**:

> We want our products to be more user-friendly, easy to navigate, and, yes, habit-forming. Companies making their products more engaging isn’t necessarily engaging – it’s progress.

WTF? There is not one sentence that ends with <q>it’s progress</q> which is not dogmatic and problematic.

Herbert A. Simon, 1971:

> the wealth of information means a dearth of something else … a poverty of attention.

Because of capitalist drives and ambitions, <q>something as seemingly healthy as a pedometer can mutate into a harmful distraction</q>. See Zoë Chance’s case. The root cause triggering distraction and enabling such manipulation is much deeper, and it is concealed by fake, distraction-accruing devices.
