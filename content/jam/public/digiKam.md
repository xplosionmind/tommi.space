  Insights and personal notes on digiKam: tips, workflows, ideas.
---
I seriously used [digiKam](https://digikam.org 'digiKam official website') for the first time to select and organize [the 1600+ pictures](https://archive.org/scambi-2022 'Scambi Festival 2022 Collection on the Internet Archive') of [the second edition of Scambi Festival](https://scambi.org/2022 'Scambi Festival 2022'). It was messy and itchy at first, I needed to figure out a lot of stuff and make up [Scambi Festival digiKam workflow](https://manuale.scambi.org/tools/storage/digikam 'digiKam page in Scambiâ€™s Manual'), but I ended up loving it. Above all, what makes it awesome is that it groups together a lot of features and tools I needed that I struggled with before. Everything is in one place and their use is perfectly integrated.

I would love to start using it for my personal media management, but I have 20000+ pictures so far, and it is a huge amount of work to switch to such a system, regardless of its greatness. Furthermore, I gotta learn how to effectively integrate it with [[Darktable]].
