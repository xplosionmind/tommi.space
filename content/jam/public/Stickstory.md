During [Portorož Youth Health Forum 2023](Portorož%20Youth%20Health%20Forum%202023.md), while having a chat with [Batool](https://linkedin.com/in/batool-alwahdani-246307137 'Batool Alwahdani on Linkedin'), she noticed the back of my laptop being completely covered by stickers. Mindlessly, I told her <q>the stickers on the back of your laptop should tell the story of your life</q>. Without intending to, I conceived an important [life](Living.md) statement.

Thus, I am hereby founding the artistic political philosophical scientific transcendental current of Stickstory.

## Manifesto

1. The back of people’s laptops should be filled with stickers
2. The stickers on the back of a laptop should tell the story of its owner
