description: Practices for improving the self, its connection to the surrounding environment and living life in the best possible way

I am a clumsy, messy, confused guy.
Most of the times, I need to work hard to achieve a result that a more determined and focused person can accomplish faster and better. For this reason, I often end up stuck in [Metathinking](Metathinking.md), and get into a loop of frustration that is simply useless. Nevertheless, overthinking my ways of doing things and dealing with life is not all bad.

I take note of the conclusions I draw from the above-mentioned tinkering.
The ones below are the most relevant practices I try to adopt, in order to be more self-aware, and to improve myself both physically and spiritually.

- When I have a thorny matter I cannot stop thinking about, I practive [Self debugging](Self%20debugging.md), which consists in sitting down, breathing, switching off anything which is switchable, and debug myself, as you would do with a computer program.
- [Self tracking](Self%20tracking.md) means keeping track of anything which has to or should not occur repetitively
- [Loops](Loops.md): acquire habits and take advantage of them to waste less time
- I set some [boundaries](Boundaries.md), attempting to limit some unhealthy or unethical practices.
- Pursue the art of [Monotasking](Monotasking.md): doing one thing at a time, only one. One.
- Every day, at the end of the day, check what has been accomplished and what went wrong through an <i lang='it'>[Esame di coscienza](Esame%20di%20coscienza.md)</i>
- [Mindfulness](Mindfulness.md) is becoming very popular and more and more people start doing it. I struggle a lot in doing it properly, but I know it is useful and I have not given up on it. The art of training the mind to focus and commit to the present by gifting it with few minutes a day of complete nothingness.
- [Being a self editor](Being%20a%20self%20editor.md): understanding what is important for the self in the whole life picture, as an editor does with its movie.
- I hate [Productivity](Productivity.md)
