> The Semantic Web is specifically a web of machine-readable information whose meaning is well-defined by standards: it absolutely needs the <u>interoperable infrastructure</u> that only global standard protocols can provide.

<p class='cite'>Tim Berners Lee, <cite>Spinning the Semantic Web</cite>, Foreword</p>

> There was a second goal for the Web, which was dependent on the first: if one could imagine a project (company, whatever) that used the Web in its work, then there would be a map, in cyberspace, of all the dependencies and relationships that defined how the project was going.

page XV:
