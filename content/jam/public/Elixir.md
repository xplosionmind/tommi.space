I first heard of [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org) by discovering <cite>[Bonifre](https://bonfirenetworks.org)</cite>, the coolest Fediverse software ever. I was very curious about it, but, as usual, I was overwhelmed with information, and I just labeled it as <q>an intriguing and very niche programming language</q>.

Then, while having a beer with [Giacomo](https://fishinthecalculator.me) at [WHY2025](https://why2025.org), we got in a super captivating conversation with [Tim Pritlove](https://mastodon.social/@timpritlove), and he told us the whole story of Erlang and Elixir, making us super excited about it. This got me thinking that I really want to learn Elixir and experiment with it. Keeping notes here about it.
