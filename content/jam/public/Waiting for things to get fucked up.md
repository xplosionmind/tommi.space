I have this thing, especially when I watch movies or series, that I just can’t enjoy cool things because I fear for things to get fucked up. Why is it going so good? There are many possible reasons for things to get fucked up.

It also happens when I see things that are high risk and over which I have no control at all. I don’t as much fear as I feel *embarassment*, and I keep being on the edge.

The only thing I could think of while watching the last episodes of the second season of [[The Bear]] was just <q>somebody is going to screw up</q> (and I felt it would be Carmen with Claire).
