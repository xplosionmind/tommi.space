[[Ode to plain text#Email|Plain text emails are to be preferred]]. Nevertheless, not to abandon formatting altogether, it would be great to have an email client that supports Markdown formatting: emails are sent in plaintext format, but their Markdown syntax is rendered on-device by the client. To my knowledge, such a client (or such a client extension) does not exist, yet.

## +++ Missing

- That MacOS email client that did it first
- Thunderbird plugin and limitations
