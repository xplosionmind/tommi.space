  Linuxplosion is my awesome workstation, which I assembled in 2019 to edit a short movie. Now, I use it for my heaviest computing tasks, such as video editing or image processing.

The original fundamental purpose of building <cite>Linuxplosion</cite> was editing [Everyone](https://tommi.space/everyone 'Everyone'). Some computerphiles friends joined me in finding the best components to use, as well as in assembling the computer. In particular, a huge shout-out to my friend Giorgio, who had the patience of bearing with me during all of the assembling process.

I worked as a plumber all of August 2019 to buy it, and it has definitely been worth it. We finished assembling it the 5<sup>th</sup> of August.

Originally, the computer run Windows, but in 2020 I switched to Ubuntu. The only program which I miss is Lightroom (that runs in a <abbr title='Virtual Machine'>VM</abbr>, anyways), everything else works beautifully.  
I do not use <cite>Linuxplosion</cite> much since it is not physically in the same city I live in.
