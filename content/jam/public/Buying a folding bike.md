description: Notes on buying a folding bicycle (aka “vouwfiets” in Dutch).
permalink: /vouwfiets/

I am committing to travelling less and less by plane, hopefully stopping completely as soon as possible. One of the perks of other means of travelling is much cheaper, if not free. Therefore, having a bike to bring with me everywhere I go would be super useful, and very cool too, to be honest eheh.

There are only two people I know who travel a lot with a folding bike, [Valerio Gatto](https://www.instagram.com/valeriogattobonanni/ '@valeriogattobonanni on Instagram') and [Jon Worth](https://gruene.social/@jon '@jon on gruene.social').

I texted Valerio and he made me understand that I can get valuable bikes only for around 600€. Cheaper ones might be solid choices, but they aren’t a big deal.

I found only these two articles from Jon Worth:

- [Turning a 2001 Riese und Müller Birdy into a modern folding bicycle - Jon Worth](https://jonworth.eu/turning-a-2001-riese-und-muller-birdy-into-a-modern-folding-bicycle/)
- [Modernising a Dahon - MINI folding bicycle - Jon Worth](https://jonworth.eu/modernising-a-dahon-mini-folding-bicycle/)

They are very interesting, but not particularly useful to decide what to buy.

## Cheap beginning

The most famous and reliable brand for folding bikes is [Brompton](https://global.brompton.com/ 'Brompton bikes website'), but it is very expensive, and, in general, all folding bikes are very pricey.

[Luca](https://pzwiki.wdka.nl/mediadesign/User:Lucatorsera 'User:Lucatorsera - XPUB & Lens-Based wiki') recently bought a used Strida, and he told me he isn’t super happy with it because it’s not too comfortable for cycling more than 15 minutes. Nevertheless, he told me <q>I got it because it’s stylish</q>, and indeed Strida bikes look very cool.

[I searched for a Strida bike on Marktplaats](https://www.marktplaats.nl/l/fietsen-en-brommers/fietsen-vouwfietsen/#q:strida%7CofferedSince:Een%20week 'Search on Marktplaats for Strida bikes being sold in the Netherlands in the past week'), and [I found this one](https://www.marktplaats.nl/v/fietsen-en-brommers/fietsen-vouwfietsen/m2327077653-strida-16-inch-silverbrush-in-nette-gebruikte-staat-te-koop 'Strida 16 inch silverbrush in nette gebruikte staat te koop – Marktplaats'). My bid of 140€ was accepted, and it looked like a very good deal, considering that Luca paid 200€ for an almost identical one.

I have testing using it for a couple days, and I have to say it is quite uncomfortable to carry around when folded, mainly because it is fairly heavy, but I believe it is definitely worth the price. Maybe, if I find myself using it a lot, I will sell this and get a Brompton.
