Between the end of 2025 and the first few days of 2026, I am going to:

- Barcelona, on the weekend of the 13-14, to participate in the meeting between [GenEtica](https://www.bancaetica.it/git/genetica/?tab=chi-siamo 'GenEtica sul sito di Banca Etica') and [JóvenesxFiare](https://www.fiarebancaetica.coop/jovenesxfiare/).
- Riva Ligure (Sanremo), my hometown, for Christmas
- Hamburg, for [39C3](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2025/infos/startpage.html), from the 26th until the 31st of December
- Berlin for New Year’s eve
- Rotterdam around January 7th, when classes start again.

I bought a discounted 5-days Interrail ticket last summer, and I believe this is the perfect opportunity to take advantage of it. I also just bought a wonderful [folding bike](Buying%20a%20folding%20bike.md)

## Travel log

It would have been wonderful to write a commentary of this trip as a blog post, but I am too discontinuous and overwhelmed to take the time to focus on writing things down properly. Therefore, I will just curate a little thread on the Fediverse, using the hashtag `#Winterrail2025`.

## Journey planning

Here are my notes about the planning of the trip, and the booking of the reservations, when mandatory. I am not sorting the trips chronologically, but rather based on when I booked the reservation. Some parts of the trip are not here because I did not book them yet.

### Tips, resources, and tricks

-  As per [Jon Worth’s Interrail tips and tricks](https://jonworth.eu/interrail-tips-and-tricks/ 'Interrail tips and tricks – Jon Worth'),
	- it might not be worth it to travel with an Interrail Pass in France and in Spain,
	- it is cheaper to book reservations from [Rail Europe](https://raileurope.com),
	- it is way cheaper to book Trenitalia reservations from [ÖBB](https://shop.oebbtickets.at/en/).
- The Interrail website confirms that it is very expensive and relatively complicated to travel with an Interrail Pass in France, and it is not allowed to use it for OuiGo trains.
- My friend [Mario](https://mario.restuccia.re/ 'Mario Restuccia') told me that <q>Eurostar is a scam</q>, and I blindly trust him, especially when it comes to cross border railway advice.
- [Instructions on Seat61](https://www.seat61.com/interrail-and-eurail-reservations.htm) are super useful to make conscious reservations when travelling with an Interrail Pass

### Rotterdam Centraal → Paris Nord

 I tried to avoid it, but it is a nightmare to get from Rotterdam to Paris without Eurostar. The alternatives are having a 7+ hours trip or having to change many times and book many different tickets on different platforms…

My last class is on Dec 10<sup>th</sup> and I have to be in Barcelona by 19:00 of Dec 12<sup>th</sup> so I will be tight on time and I was forced to book a reservation for Friday 11<sup>th</sup> on Rail Europe (see tips and tricks above) for 32€.

### Taggia Arma → Hamburg Hauptbanhof

I had to buy two different reservations for Taggia → Genova Piazza Principe and for Genova Piazza Principe → Milano Centrale from ÖBB. I paid 3€ each.

I got very frustrated because I could not get a reservation for Milano Centrale → Mannheim Hbf neither on ÖBB, nor Eurail. On Rail Europe I even got a weird message saying that the reservation had to be booked at the station, but I would never risk it, especially during a 15min connection.

Luckily, not only I was able to book Milano to Mannheim, but I got Milano Centrale → Hamburg Hauptbanhof on DB for 13€.

### Paris Gare de Lyon → Barcelona Sants

There were very, very few options for this leg of the trip… There are no sleeper trains from Paris. There are only two options that arrive in other places that are still at least six hours away from Barcelona.

Therefore, I had to choose between a 7 and a 14 TGV. I chose the former, reserving the spot on Rail Europe for 35€.

### Hostel in Marseilles

I am privileged enough to have many wonderful friends who host me all over Europe. When I don’t have any acquaintances living in a place where I am staying, I reach out to potential hosts on [Trustroots](https://trustroots.org) and [Couchers](https://couchers.org). Because I always manage to find someone nice that welcomes me in their home for free, I have little/no experience with finding good hostels deals.

Unfortunately, in the case of Marseille I have no friends in the area, and all my requests on Trustroots and Couchers were unsuccessful. Therefore, I had to look for a hostel. I had no idea how to do it.

I randomly looked for <q>Hostels in Marseille</q> on [Startpage](https://startpage.com), and, after a few searches on [Booking](https://booking.com) and similar mainstream services, I found <cite lang=fr>[Hôtel Vertigo](https://www.hotelvertigo.fr)</cite>, that seemed to have good ratings and a nice vibe. I managed to book two nights in a 8-beds room for a total of 44€, taxes included. I was very disappointed I could not verify if the website I got the tickets from was the actual site of the hostel, or if I used a third-party vendor—that is something that I always try to avoid, by making a direct purchase.

### Barcelona Sants → Marseille Saint-Charles

The line is not too busy or requested, so I risked booking a reservation a bit later. I got it for 12€ from the Interrail website, as there were no cheaper options available. The most convenient direct train, from every perspective, leaves Barcelona at 16:31 and arrives in Marseilles at 21:30.
