I heard about [Aaron Swartz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz 'Aaron Swartz on Wikipedia') for the first time while discussing why [I quit social media](https://quitsocialmedia.club 'quitsocialmedia.club') with a friend, and she said that I reminded her of him. I was very interested about him, so I searched for him on Wikipedia, and immediately I realized how humbling the comparison was, and how crazy it was that I did not know about him before.

By diving deeper and deeper in his biography and his legacy (in particular after watching <cite>[The Internet‚Äôs Own Boy: The Story of Aaron Swartz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Internet's_Own_Boy '‚ÄúThe Internet‚Äôs Own Boy: The Story of Aaron Swartz‚Äù on Wikipedia')</cite>), I fell in love with him and with what he stood for. He is now [one of my most inspiring idols](/people/#aaron-swartz 'Aaron Swartz in the list of all my favorite people'), and that his initiatives perfectly match with my philosophy and my political interpretation of the Internet. This is why [I dedicated](https://ournet.rocks/weaver-kit/#aaron 'Section about Aaron in the Weaver kit of Knitting Our Internet') to him <cite>[Knitting Our Internet](https://ournet.rocks/ 'ü™° Knitting Our Internet üß∂')</cite>, my workshop about the history, the future, and the political value of the Internet.

Among his many endeavours, I am particularly fascinated about his pursuing [[Common Knowledge]] and making [[Knowledge|learning resources]] accessible to all.

I re-watched the documentary several times, and I took some notes during the re-watch we had with some friends, while I was writing my thesis.
