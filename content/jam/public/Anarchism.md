description: Thoughts, insights, and ideas about Anarchism
---
Lately, I’ve had many thoughts on Anarchism and anarchist practice. At a recent <cite>[Introduction to Anarchism](https://2023.antiuniversity.org/events/introduction-to-anarchism 'Introduction to Anarchism | AntiUniversity 2023')</cite> session I attended at [AntiUniversity 2023](https://2023.antiuniversity.org 'AntiUniversity x Anarchist Bookfair 2023') in London, I was taken aback when I shared my personal definition of Anarchist practice, which I now commit to as my most fundamental value.

## Self, not Ego

Many believe that in an anarchist society represses personal preferences and desires are suppressed, annihilating the individual within the societal context. However, I believe this claim to be highly inaccurate. In fact, both modern communism and anarchism place significant value on the identities of the individuals composing a society. The main contrast with our capitalistic society is the removal of egoistic and spiteful impulses that fuel an individual’s **ego**, thereby leaving room for the authentic flourishing of the **self** *within* the community, not in spite of it.
