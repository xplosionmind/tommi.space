description: Stop depending on unethical Google services and start using healthier, often even better, alternatives
---
Google is one of the most famous companies in the world, and its tech services are by the most widely used. Even if in proportion the amount of users quitting it is minimal, the number of people stopping to use Google Services is growing bigger every day.

While I keep working on a more detailed and exhaustive article on the topic, below are some great writings about alternatives to Googleâ€™s services and about the reason why quitting Google is not nonsense. Note: quitting Google does not mean being against Google no matter what!

<div class='yellow box'>
	<strong>update</strong>: it has been more than one year since I started thinkering about dropping Google and working out new and better alternatives. Now, I am done and exhausted. Hence I definitely will not write something comprehensive about this in the near future, I should have taken step-by-step notes while studying the topic, before getting tired and wanting to move on.
