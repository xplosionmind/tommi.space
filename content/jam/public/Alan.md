description: Concept of a social network in which the algorithm governing it is built and defined by its users as if it was a LEGO.
---
<cite>Alan</cite> is a concept for a social network whose algorithmic bias is overcome by user empowerment, through the individual, conscious, informed personalization of algorithmic criteria.

The algorithm deciding what to show or prioritize in a feed should be simply and straightforwardly built and modified by the user as if it was a building block.

## Inspiration

- <cite>[Thinking Outside the Black-Box: The Case for “Algorithmic Sovereignty” in Social Media](https://doi.org/10.1177/2056305120915613)</cite>

## Update: It exists!

I believe [Bonfire](https://bonfirenetworks.org/ 'Bonfire: Open Federated Technology for Autonomous Digital Spaces') to be absolutely formidable, and it definitely reflects the core concepts of my initial idea.

Actually, Bluesky custom timelines perfectly match Alan’s core concept.
