<div class='blue box'>
	I have my own <a href='https://pixelfed.org' title='Pixelfed official website'>Pixelfed</a> instance on <a href='https://tmi.pics' title='TMI Pics Pixelfed instance'>TMI Pics</a>, most of what is written here refers to it.

## Customizations

Here are the customizations I made to my Pixelfed instance, to make it feel a bit more like home. I am keeping track of them since I am no expert of server maintenance and I know how to behave and what to change when the app is updated.

- favicon
	- replace `/var/www/pixelfed/public/favicon.ico`
	- replace `/var/www/pixelfed/public/img/favicon.png`
