## Add-ons and Extensions

Three different add-ons configurations can be found in my [Firefox Collections](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/collections/13538650 'Tommi’s Firefox Collections'):

- [minimal](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/collections/13538650/minimal/ '“minimal” extensions collection') configuration: *must-have* add-ons for a safe and optimized browsing experience.
- [main](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/collections/13538650/main/ '“main” extensions collection') configuration: the main extensions I use, including integrated tools to take advantage of the services I use.
- [extra](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/collections/13538650/extra/ '“extra” extensions collection - Firefox AddOns') configuration: extra notable addons.

## Monoline

I created the custom theme [Firefox Monoline](https://codeberg.org/tommi/firefox-monoline 'firefox-monoline source code on Codeberg'), archived in January 2025.
