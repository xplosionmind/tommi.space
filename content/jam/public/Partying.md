I have always underestimated and misconceived partying.

I have always lived and envisioned parties as ephemeral moments of freedom, parentheses of wildness. Indeed, I am still convinced they are. My problem so far has been presupposing an implicit spirit of serenity and peace to partake in one. Therefore, it is very rare for me to actually enjoy them, as I am (everyone is) never completely cleansed from worries, stress, or priority tasks.

It is much needed a sharp change of perspective. By learning to overlook stress and doubtfulness, I need to embrace partying and value it for what it really is.

Only after having lived in Berlin I can admit I confused partying with [[Clubbing]]/rave/techno/dancing. They are not the same.

## House partying

Before my life in Berlin, I mixed partying with clubbing/techno/dancing. I realized my kind of things are **house parties**, with their friendliness, chillness, coziness.

Even though they are not as hardcore and intense, I reckon house parties possess several perks.

- **Networking**. In the end, parties are where and when people meet the most.
- **Taking a break**. Parties should not be lived as a reward for good work and satisfaction, but as pauses to commitment, hence *much needed* occasions to reset social anxiety and mental approach, no matter what.
- **Alcool**. Useless to say, drinking sometimes helps seeing things better.
