**<cite>Computer Sciences Are Social Sciences</cite>** is the thesis I wrote for my [PISE](https://unive.it/pise 'Philosophy, International Studies, and Economics – Ca’ Foscari University') bachelor degree. I wrote it between February and June 2023. After my graduation, I also held some presentations and talks about the topic.

[This repository](https://codeberg.org/tommi/csss 'csss repository on Codeberg') contains all the source files and resources related to the thesis.

## Workshop: *Knitting Our Internet*

Since I feel very strongly about the topics of this thesis, I have been thinking hard of ways to inform and involve people.
Out of this effort, a workshop came out, and I am thrilled to ne hosting it in many amazing occasions, with diverse crowds of various ages.

The workshop is called [***Knitting Our Internet***](https://tommi.space/ournet/ 'Knitting our Internet, tommi.space').

## Feedback and corrections

I am keen to discuss about anything related to this thesis! <a href='{{ site.encoded_mailto }}' title='Write me an email'>Get in touch</a> if you’d like!

I wrote my thesis as a young undergraduate student. Even if it is highly unlikely, there might be information that is partly or even fully incorrect. I apologise for this, and I invite you to contact me if you spot any kind of mistake!

### Obsolescence

The text of the thesis **is not being updated**. Please, be aware that there might be information that becomes incorrect or wrong because of obsolescence.
