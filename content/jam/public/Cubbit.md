[Cubbit] is a brilliant and revolutionary decentralized cloud service.

On top of the awesomeness of the service, I am a fan of Cubbit also for several particular reasons:
- I am among the first backers of the project
- I proudly own two Cubbit cells
- Cubbit is sponsoring <cite>[Scambi Festival](https://scambi.org)</cite>
- I met Stefano Onofri, Cubbit CEO, and he showed me around Bologna, the city where Cubbit was born. It was a great experience and I had the opportunity of seeing the enthusiasm and commitment Cubbiters have!

The only problem of Cubbit is that, being so cutting-edge, its development is sloooow and new features are rolled out very, very rarely.
