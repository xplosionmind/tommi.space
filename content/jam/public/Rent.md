<cite>[Rent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rent_(musical) '“Rent” on Wikipedia')</cite> is one of the things I love the most, and, of course, its [2005 representation in movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rent_(film) '“Rent”, the movie on Wikipedia') is one of my [favorite films](Cinema.md#Favorites).

How can a musical be so inspiring and true I really cannot understand.  
I just know I deeply love [Jonathan Larson](https://tommi.space/people#jonathan-larson 'Jonathan Larson among my favorite people — tommi.space').

[Here](https://www.awesomefilm.com/script/rent.txt 'The whole script of “Rent„ (2005)') is the whole script.

## Everything is rent!

> We’re not gonna pay  
> Last year’s rent  
> This year’s rent  
> Next year’s rent  
> Rent rent rent rent rent  
> We’re not gonna pay rent  
> ‘Cause **[everything is rent](Pan.md#Name)**

## La vie bohème

> To days of inspiration  
> Playing hooky, **making [something out of nothing](https://youtube-nocookie.com/embed/V_YlZ1JdcVk '“Something From Nothing„ — Foo Fighters')**  
> The need to express  
> To communicate,  
> To going against the grain,  
> Going insane  
> Going mad  
> To **loving tension**, no pension  
> To more than one dimension,  
> To **starving for attention**,  
> Hating convention, hating pretension  
> Not to mention of course,  
> Hating dear old mom and dad  
> To riding your bike,  
> Midday past the three-piece suits  
> To fruits to no absolutes  
> To Absoluteto choice  
> To the Village Voice  
> To any passing fad  
> **To being an us**-for once-, **instead of a them**

At 1:23:44, like [Pier Paolo Pasolini](Pier%20Paolo%20Pasolini.md):

> Anyone out of the mainstream  
> Is anyone in the mainstream?  
> Anyone alive with a sex drive

### Creation

> The opposite of war isn’t peace, it’s creation

What the Pope underscored in <a href='https://www.raiplay.it/video/2022/02/Sua-Santita-Papa-Francesco---Che-Tempo-Che-Fa-06022022-b952f77e-474f-4d8b-bba2-153e49b646e3.html' title='Intervista a Papa Francesco - Che Tempo Che Fa' hreflang='it'>his interview</a> at minute 10.

## It was before I met you

Mimi and Roger (1:40:40) as Dolores and Andrea in <cite lang='it'>[Santa Maradona](Santa%20Maradona.md)</cite>

> <q>Roger…nothing happened. Benny and me, it’s over. We had a thing once, but it was two years ago</q>  
> <q>It doesn’t matter</q>  
> <q>It was before I met you…</q>  
> <q>I don’t care</q>
