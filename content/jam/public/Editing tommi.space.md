A couple of weeks ago, during the traditional hike with the FSFE community after [SFSCON](https://sfscon.it/), I have strolled for a long time alongside [Julian](https://juliansparber.com/ 'Julian’s personal website') and [Tobias](https://tobiasbernard.com/ 'Tobias’ personal website'). It was incredibly inspiring, because I never had the chance to speak so extensively (or at all, actually) with [GNOME](https://www.gnome.org/ 'GNOME') developers—the developers of the desktop environment I use for many hours everyday.

Among the many interesting topics we discussed, I brought up the conflicting feelings I have concerning old pages in my website. There are things I wrote a while ago with which I do not agree at all anymore, or they feel stupid, or I changed my mind about them. Should I make an effort to *update* the content every time? Should I keep them as they are adding a disclaimer saying that I changed my mind, or should I simply delete them?

During the walk, Tobias and [Dario](https://pan.rent/@dario 'Dario on Pan') told me that they believed it made no sense to keep things online just for the sake of “preserving” past memories. The most blatant example is [Claire Underwood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claire_Underwood 'Claire Underwood on Wikipedia'). I would most definitely *not* be adding her to my list of favorite people, now. Should I just remove her, or add a flag in [the JSON data file]({{ site.source }}/src/branch/main/data/people.json 'people.json file in tommi.space’s repository, on Codeberg') collecting the list of people, preventing her card to be displayed [in the final HTML page](people.liquid)? It also crossed my mind that, even if it was something I would be ashamed of, it is still part of the many naive positions I had, so it is might be worthy of staying there where it is.

Another thing to be noted is that a lot of content written in the Jam (or on this website in general) between 2020 and 2022 was the result of a quite obsessive quest of digitally logging and registering *anything and everything* about me and my life (see <cite>[Rethinking tommi.space](/v2/)</cite>), also in a failing pointless attempt of showing off. I was valuing quantity over quality, literally.

Of course, I got to the conclusion that *it depends*. I never had any doubt about blog posts preservation, because, as far as they could be from my identity and my thoughts right now, they always state a date, and they clearly refer to a specific date/period of my life. On the other hand, whenever I have doubts, I should just have the courage of *letting go*, remove obsolete content, clean things up. As this website is the virtual representation of my mind, being [*the editor of myself*](Being%20a%20self-editor.md).

Therefore, contrary to most major updates and refactors, this huge update of tommi.space *removes* a lot of content, instead of adding it.

## Practical notes

- Anything I have ever published continues to live in the [history]({{ site.changelog }}) of the git repository (good luck navigating it).
- I make my best to track [in the Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/details/@tommi_boom/web-archive 'Tommi Boom’s Webpages Archive') web pages whose evolution overtime has a meaning.
- If I remember to do it, all web pages that are permanently deleted, for whatever reason, get [saved to the Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/details/@tommi_boom/web-archive 'Tommi Boom’s Webpages Archive') before disappearing.
- As a result of this process, I hope and I expect the website to be way less confusing, meaningless, and more focused on what actually matters.
