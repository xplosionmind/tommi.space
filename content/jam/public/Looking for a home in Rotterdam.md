Since mid-May 2025 I have been looking for a room to rent in Rotterdam, as I will be moving there to study for [XPUB](https://xpub.nl).

In the meanwhile, the world is burning and the assholes holding the power and the super rich are making it hard for us to dwell in peace without spending all our money on absurd rent prices. On top of that, the Netherlands is witnessing a full-on housing crisis, making the search for a home even harder and more frustrating.

I am curating this page both as a reference for myself to keep track of all the tips and links I get, but also to start drafting a communal and crowdsourced set of resources and advice for home-seekers in Rotterdam. Feel free to suggest any change by heading to the source code of the page (see the footer). If this gets enough interest, we could consider moving it to a more impersonal and collective space where it’s also easier to contribute and edit the content.

## Unions and networks

The first and best thing to do is to spend money not merely to pay for a service, but as a political action of comradery and mutual support. I joined the [Bond Precarie Woonvormen](https://bondprecairewoonvormen.nl/en/overdebpw/) (BPW), it costs 30€ per year.

Even though joining a union doesn’t directly help in *actually finding* a home, it’s a game-changer to be informed and possibly get involved with housing rights groups in the Netherlands.

I believe the first step to make our voices heard and be a resistance is to make the search for a home politically conscious, and not to reduce it to an individualistic and self-absorbed practice. Looking for a place with political understanding of the country, its movements, its policies, and its vibe in general is the first step to make things better for everyone, not just for oneself.

They want to make us think only about ourselves but we are better and we will eventually succeed because we care about collective wellbeing, not just about our own wealth.

End of the invective.

### Cooperative housing

Given how critical the situation is, my initial idea of joining or even founding a housing cooperative is very idealistic.

Still…

The Fediverse is awesome: after [posting about this](https://pan.rent/@tommi/114290220808150401) I got many super informative replies, but above all I got connected with several beautiful human beings, including [Lea](https://bael.design), who will be my coursemate and, hopefully, my flatmate.

[Here’s the page dedicated to cooperative housing](Rotterdam%20housing%20coop.md) in particular.

## Join groupchats

Even if they are not directly related to housing, being in local groupchats, especially ones of students and internationals, it hugely valuable, as you can spread the word that you are looking for a place, and you can learn more about neighborhoods, acceptable prices, common scams, etc.

## Websites I am paying for

It’s inevitable to have to pay for some service where rental agencies and private entities pubish insertions. These are the services I ended up paying for, in the end. The most useful thing is to have instant notification about newly added insertions.

- [Stadswonen Rotterdam](https://stadswonenrotterdam.nl) is a sort of social housing company, owning properties all over the city. One-time payment of 25€.
- [Kamernet](https://kamernet.nl/en) is probably the most common solution. I am paying 70€ for three months of subscription.
- [Huurwoningen](https://www.huurwoningen.nl/en/) is more oriented for whole flats. I am splitting the 30€/month fee with Lea, with whom I am looking for a flat to split.

## Check for scams

Some flats may be published and appear as ready for rent, even though they are not actually being rented. Here are some tools to verify insertions are legitimate.

- [Stekkies checker](https://www.stekkies.com/en/check-rental-listing)
- [Zo herken je een schimmige verhuurwebsite \| Radar - het consumentenprogramma van AVROTROS](https://radar.avrotros.nl/artikel/zo-herken-je-een-schimmige-verhuurwebsite-61664)

## Random websites and agencies

- [Stekkies](https://www.stekkies.com/en/) uses AI stuff to look for you on different websites. I created an account but I haven’t paid for it, so I don’t know how effective it actually is.
- [Interhouse](https://interhouse.nl/)
- [Huure](https://huure.nl/?locale=en)
- [Funda](https://www.funda.nl/)
- [Pararius](https://www.pararius.com) (I think it’s owned by the same company that owns Huurwoningen, no idea why they have two websites)

## Interesting options

I have a friend living in a building that is going to be destroyed/renovated, and flats in it are rented to super cheap prices. Nevertheless, there are some caveats, most notably, every month you may get an eviction notice 28 days before, and you have very very few rights as a tenant.

My friend’s experience is nice, but another friend from BPW strongly advised it against this solution.

## Tips from friends

Here’s a scheme kindly made by my friend Noemi, an Italian expat student who has been living in Utrecht for the past five years:

## What I am avoiding

- **Facebook**. I deleted my profile long ago, I considered making it again just to join specific groups and search for rooms/flats insertions, but I first had a look from my mom and I realized it’s pure chaos and it’s full of scams.
