Don’t self-edit while you are writing, as it just blocks you. Do <q>ugly-writing</q>, and *then* edit.

- **Structural editing**: the hardest, as it requires to have an overview of the text, its aim, the expectations and the understanding of the reader. Why is this specific section in this specific location?
- **Line editing**: per-sentence editing, evaluating if the text is flowing and it’s understandable.
- **Elegant editing**: Only at the very end, making things as elegant as possible.

## Styles of writing

- Avoid defensive and protective writing, thinking about external validation and assumptions before writing.
- Avoid passive voice
- Avoid wordiness
- Avoid repetition
- Metaphors can help, but they can grow old and should not be overused
