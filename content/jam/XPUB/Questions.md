There is an awful lot of questions crowding my head.

After a conversation with [Thijs](https://pzwiki.wdka.nl/mediadesign/User:Thijshijsijsjss), I decided to keep track of them.

- What is the meaning of sharing and/or making personal notes public?
- How to conciliate and intertwine an individual’s identity with their digital representation and self-narration?
