At the highest level, the parent institution XPUB is part of is the Rotterdam University of Applied Sciences (RUAS), or Hogeschool Rotterdam (HR). To get a proof of enrollment, it’s necessary to go through the steps of this bureaucratic monster, and it’s confusing but actually quite straightforward. Hopefully, this page will help.

## Via app

The quickest and “simple” way to get a <q>proof</q> of enrollment is by installing the mobile application, and generating it from there. Nevertheless, this is probably useless, because it is merely a screenshot of what you would get in the app, no signatures, it does not look official at all.

## Via Students Service Center

The <cite lang=nl>[Studenten Service Center](https://www.hogeschoolrotterdam.nl/hogeschool/contact/aanmelding-en-financien/)</cite> SSC is quite fast and helpful. By requesting the Proof of Enrollment via email at ssc@hr.nl you should get it within a couple of days.
