A handful of minutes before the end of 2024, [Jacopo](https://instagram.com/jacoporomei/ '@jacoporomei on Instagram') turned to me and asked me one resolution and one revolution I would want to accomplish in 2025.

Not that I am particularly fond of these quite performative and stressful <q>Year in retrospective</q>/<q>Propositions for the next year</q> kind of posts, nor that I am fully satisfied with the response I gave to Jacopo, but I have been thinking and thinking about my spontaneous reply, and there must be a reason if on the spot I said what I said.

So, here it is, a very hypocritical self-centered account of personal thoughts and purposes from a person (me) who is very critical towards egocentrics and towards sharing things about oneself just for the sake of it. Yet another perk of being the sole owner and inhabitant of an uncensored boundless space (a.k.a. website) in the majestic marvelous mess of the World Wide Web: doing self-therapy in public and not giving a damn‚Äîactually I do give a damn, but I will feel shitty later. Now, to this year‚Äôs plan.

## The Revolution

First of all, let me make one thing clear: as much as I want to, unfortunately *my* revolution for 2025 is not *that* revolution. I never stop hoping and fighting for *that* revolution to come, but this is not what this post is about.

Although prosaic and cheesy, the very personal and somewhat intimate revolution I am striving toward is authentic, especially considering that this is the year I will be turning twenty-five years old üò±.

**Independence**.

The achievement of independence should be a process, and I hope I already embarked the path towards it. Still, I both feel and believe that true independence, nowadays, is measured in certain life milestones, whether we like it or not. As I made the thorny choice of [dropping out of my master](/now/#2025-01-11 '‚ÄúNow doing‚Äù as of the 11th of January 2025'), I am now facing the beginning of true adulthood, so to speak: finding a way to pay for rent, groceries, and many other things, including figuring out what city, what country, what continent to inhabit in the first place.

Of course the most tangible milestone of independence is the financial one, yet, more or less tied to it there are many other forms of independence, and my revolutionary purpose is to be *fully independent*, from all perspectives.

At the same time, <q>no man is an island</q> (that‚Äôs it, I reached the peak of the watered-down poetry), and I do believe full independence does not mean to seek and grab my own achievements entirely alone, as the neoliberal individualistic rhetoric wants to put it. I do think that <q>happiness is only real when shared</q> (ok, I guess that the cheesy quotes will never end), and I want to pursue my wellbeing in a choral, collective perspective, never merely egoistical. In the end, though, despite the immense priviledge of having marvellous human beings around me, an invaluable safety net made by my family and my friends, a clear answer is impossible to find.

Therefore, I am taking a toll, mostly in terms of anxiety, insecurity, and confusion. Deciding <u>what *not* to do</u> with one‚Äôs own life is a ridicolously trivial choice if compared to the overwhelming, impossible, and maddening question of <u>what to do</u> instead.

So here I am, sitting in [my attic](content/jam/public/Xplosion%20Attic.md), wearing the same pajama I have been wearing for the past `[ridicolous amount]` hours, asking myself: <q>what are my plans for 2025?</q> <q>What do I *actually*, *practically* intend to do with my life?</q>

Let us get back to concreteness. We shall proceed one step at a time, focusing on the *resolution*.

## The Resolution

As opposed to my obvious and broad revolution, my resolution is very specific and clear, since it reveals my intentions at a more simple and practical level.

**Learning German**.

There could not be an unfriendlier language (happy to stand corrected, and I know I would + of course no offense towards German-speaking folks), there could not be a worse timing (I lived in Berlin for one year until some months ago), and there could not be [a worse suited person](content/jam/public/Tomminess.md) as me to follow this resolution.

But again, here I am, sitting on the floor of my room, realizing that the city I want and *need* to be living in right now is the one I moved out of just a while back, and that if I want to be serious about building a life (in the mid-term, at least) in Berlin I must know German.

What is more, is that the place best place in Europe to be to get involved in ‚ÄúPolitical Technology‚Äù (even though it means everything and nothing), is definitely Berlin. There are many reasons behind this, and I cannot really explain them, but for sure there is a lively and inspiring hacker culture. Furthermore, AFAIK Germany is the most virtuous country in the European Union concerning the support and funding of Free and Open Source Software (see the [Sovereign Tech Agency](https://www.sovereign.tech/ 'Sovereign Tech Agency‚Äôs website') and the [Prototype Fund](https://prototypefund.de/en/ 'Prototype Fund‚Äôs homepage'), for example).

At this point, albeit still wildly foggy, the picture is a bit clearer: Berlin, job, ???

This purely hypothetical plan could go to ruins quickly and easily, I am prepared for that (as much as I could possibly be, considering), but I got my eyes on the prizes: the resolution and the revolution.

So here is a whole webpage all about me. I hate this. I hate to be incapable of writing insightful blog posts about topics I study and I believe in, to provide opinions, and to comment on how I am perceiving the insanity of contemporary events. Nevertheless, I realized that so far my energies have been absorbed mostly by *life*, hence the main topic of this website: *myself*. To look outwards without being triggered, overwhelmed, or suffocated, I have to get to a somewhat adult *stability*, first.

## Bonus: Stability

Stability‚Ä¶ I always overlooked its value and its importance in the deepest sense: [in the past three years of my life](stuff/activities.liquid?startDate=2022-01-14&endDate=2025-01-14), I moved on an average *every six months*. I have been doing many wonderful things, meeting incredible people, including by two best friends. Nonetheless, my plans in the long term have been *wildly* shifting, or they were non-existent, as all my focus and energies were absorbed by the short or medium term planning.

It is time to make the frightening but adult move to take action and responsibility for the years, not months, to come.

I need a revolution, indeed.

## In other news

In other news, I lived in Tallinn from September to December 2024. Remarkably, Tallinn is the only city I have lived in that does not have any page of this website dedicated to it. The place is lovely, but it is definitely not *my* place, not during this phase of my life. My time there has been mostly reflexive and mysanthropic, particularly because it was haunted by the questions outlined above.

Anyhow, I definitely cannot complain, because notwithstanding the challenging times, I met interesting and nice people, and I travelled a lot, hosting <cite>[Knitting Our Internet](https://ournet.rocks/ 'Knitting Our Internet‚Äôs website')</cite> at [many great events](stuff/activities.liquid?startDate=2024-09-01&endDate=2024-12-31), where I bonded with other incredible, insightful, and lovely people.

It is very weird to feel both very glad and super unsatisfied about a phase of my life, at the same time. It is what it is, I guess, and it is time to move on.

I am eagerly waiting for feedback on *one* position I applied to recently, but I am sending many of them for many different projects, jobs, and courses. In the meanwhile, I am finishing some work I had to get to, sooner or later.

A more complete account of what I am doing now is, as always, [in the <cite>Now</cite> page](/now/#2025-01-14).

### tommi.space version 3

Being hopelessly nerd, of course I am marking the beginning of this new unclear chapter of my life, guess how, [by releasing a new version of my website]({{ site.source }}/releases/tag/v3 'Version 3 release of tommi.space, on Codeberg').

As opposed to [version 2](/v2/), which was chiefly symbolic, [version 3](content/jam/public/Meta.md#version-3) is mostly technical, instead. Since last June, I have been playing with [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev/ 'Eleventy‚Äôs website'), and [I changed virtually *everything* behind the scenes](content/jam/public/Meta.md) of tommi.space.

I am still not completely satisfied with the current status, but I think I will never be, it is <u>an eternal work in progress</u>!

### Launching <cite>Knitting Our Internet</cite>

Even though the workshop was ready since September 2024, and its website‚Äôs development was almost complete, I soft-launched the project without any big announcement or press release, because there were a few little details that I wanted to fix first.

Thankfully, I now have a bit more time to address these remaining issues, and I plan to fully launch Knitting Our Internet by (or at) [FOSDEM](https://2025.fosdem.org 'FOSDEM 2025‚Äôs website') and [OFFDEM](https://offdem.net 'OFFDEM‚Äôs website').
