		<h1>Everyone</h1>
		<h2>Love awakens</h2>
		<p>
			I had this story stuck in my head, and the only way to get it out was to tell it. So I wrote a short-movie about it. Somehow, I found a way to produce it, and, eventually, in 2019 I filmed it. It took several long, long months of hard work whith my friends, who where kind and crazy enough to trust and follow me in this adventure.<br>
			I actually am someone who wonâ€™t take off his pajama no matter what. Filming <cite>Everyone</cite> made me think Everyone should wake upâ€”and love.
