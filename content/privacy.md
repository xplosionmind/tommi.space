This website does not gather any data about its visitors. Since I am in full control of <cite>[[Nebuchadnezzar]]</cite>, the server where tommi.space is hosted, all I could know are the IP addresses that connect to it. Nevertheless, I don’t care about this information and I don’t really know how to gather this data.

By subscribing to my newsletter, you will be giving me your email address, and, optionally, your name. To send the newsletter I use [listmonk](https://listmonk.app 'listmonk official website'), which is installed on <cite>[[Nebuchadnezzar]]</cite>, too.

I will not share the data in my possession with anyoneə, nor will I use it for purposes other than sending newsletters. I will be forced to surrender such information only if I receive a warrant from judicial authorities. Upon request, I may permanently delete all data in my possession relating to any person who can prove his or her identity.
