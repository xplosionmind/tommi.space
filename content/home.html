			{% renderTemplate "md" %}
				In 2021 **I deleted all my profiles** on social media—[with the exception of Linkedin](https://linkedin.com/in/tommasomarmo 'Tommaso Marmo on Linkedin') (need it for work…).

				<u>I firmly believe that the reasons of my choice are not merely personal, but they are **universal**</u>! What is personal is the weight that each and everyone of us gives to the pro and cons of these platforms. After weighting all the factors on my personal weight, I would not stand the anxiety social media cause(d) me. I grew extremely intolerant to social media [enshittification](https://en.wikitionary.org/wiki/enshittification '“enshittification” on Wikitionary'), so I quit.

				Still, I also wanted to push as many people as possible to at least learn more about this. Therefore, to foster questioning of social media starting from a unique—yet comprehensive and reliable—source, I created <cite>[quitsocialmedia.club](https://quitsocialmedia.club/home 'Quit Social Media!')</cite>. There, I gathered <u>all the worrisome issues of social media</u>, together with related articles, videos or even research.

				For better or worse, a lot has changed since I created the website: its content and its arguments could be relatively obsolete or limited. In any case, I still think that exploring quitsocialmedia.club could be a great starting point to approach this critical topic.

				At the same time, my thinking matured, too. Nurtured by readings, lectures, research, and dialogues my opinion matured. Essentially, I became more conscious of the **intersectionality of the fights** I support. [My thesis](/csss 'Computer Sciences are Social Sciences!') goes deeper, investigating the problem at the root of [all the ones tackled by <cite>Quit Social Media</cite>](https://quitsocialmedia.club), also by proposibg a new Socio-Philosophical approach to Computer Sciences. Recently, I conceived and I am taking around the world [a workshop]() to foster collective reflections and participatively theorize new solutions. I would love for you to invite me to do the workshop somewhere, but you could even do it by yourselves!

				I am not a <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Luddism' title='Neo-Luddism on Wikipedia' hreflang='en'>Luddist</a>, condemning contemporary technology no matter what. I am not a mysanthrope out of the world, either. I proudly use **alternative, decentralized, and independent social networks**. [You can find me](https://pan.rent/@tommi 'Tommi on Pan') in the <cite><a href='/fediverse' title='About the Fediverse'>Fediverse</a></cite>, and I can’t wait for you to get in touch!
