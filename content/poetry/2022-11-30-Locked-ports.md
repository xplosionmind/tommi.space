I was restlessly clashing  
`22` `22` `22` `22` `22` `22`  
against that damned SSH port  
yet you, logged in,  
showing off your tender sweet `id_rsa`,  
softly pink, mysteriously **right**

Mine, stubborn as always,  
like me.  
Relentlessly obnoxiously  
I changed my IP, then SFTP, even VNC.  
Still,  
`22` `22` `22` `22` `22` `22`  

How delusional, believing  
that once I could have connected with you,  
fabulously, daydreaming, we would  
have spent a VPS honeymoon.

No worries for any virtualization  
or Docker  
or Nginx,  
no containers or fucking RAM,  
travelling, candidly wobbling,  
no tribulation of any kind  
and living with a spirit filled with…

`… Connection timed out.`
