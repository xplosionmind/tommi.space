It is hard to completely grasp the power one email possesses. Actually, it is incredible how such a basic tool can result in an overwhelming dose of unbelievable emotions, when exploited by people driven by actual love and enthusiasm.

I am an enthusiast. Arguably, I am an over-enthusiastic extrovert who is particularly confused in his way of manifesting such feeling and its attributes. When it comes to writing emails, though, I harness this quality of mine (probably my only one) to create meaningful connections and take advantage of them to do my small tiny bitsy minute part in trying to make the world a better place, making B-P proud.

> Try and leave this world a little better than you found it, and when your turn comes to die, you can die happy in feeling that at any rate, you have not wasted your time but have done your best.

<p class='cite'>Robert Baden-Powell</p>

Cheesy quotes aside, I feel that I need to share this, even though I have not been writing on here since quite some time.

Admitting the human you are writing your email to has an open heart and if spam filtering does not behave like the f\*cking moron it is, then you are definitely building your future.

I am nobody to state how one’s future should be built. Even more, I am only at the beginning of my future-building process, and I have a way to go that is so long I cannot even think envision its magnitude.

Nonetheless, I write a lot of emails. I send them to people I admire, as well as organizations I would love to work with—even if I do not always ask to work together. Most emails do not get any reply, most of the remaining ones get negative or dismissing replies, and the very few times I get an answer I get thrown off my chair for even getting some positive feedback.

I experienced the astounding waterfall effect one replay can have thanks to [Wendy Hanamura](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wendyhanamura 'Wendy Hanamura on LinkedIn'). Not only she gave credit to a frantic and overwhelming unsolicited email, but after getting in touch she invited me to some super insightful conversations at [Unfinished Camp](https://unfinished.com/camp/ 'Unfinished Camp: Venice') before even meeting me.

Thanks to this unbelievable connection we established, I met great people who, in only two days, opened my eyes and my mind as very few experiences did up to now.

Later on, Wendy revealed to me that she considered my email, among the many ones she receives every day, because of the enthusiasm it was driven by, along with this comprehensive list of ideas of ways we could connect [Scambi Festival](https://scambi.org 'Scambi Festival') and [DWeb Camp](https://dwebcamp.org 'DWeb Camp').

This is why I am writing this disordered collection of sentences:

dear readers,  
dear Tommi of the future,  
dear Tommi in low self-esteem periods,

write enthusiasm-driven emails.
