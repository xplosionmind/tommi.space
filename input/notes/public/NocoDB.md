I briefly tested [NocoDB](https://nocodb.org 'NocoDB official website') before deciding to go for [Baserow](https://baserow.io 'Baserow official website'). This page collects some quick questions I had about it.

- How to set both `Year` and `MultiSelect`
- how to perform actions after all rows have been selected
- convert column format from `SingleLineText` to `Date`
- merge tables
	- importing data and automatically merging duplicates
	- “append” two tables
- date importing format
- adding the cross reference of “link to another value” to the same column (e.g. PIX)
- migration to another instance
	- import/export NocoDB formats
- Filter out sensitive columns in certain views
