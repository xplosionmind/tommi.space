description: Concept of a social network in which the algorithm governing it is built and defined by its users as if it was a LEGO.
---
<cite>Alan</cite> is a concept for a social network whose algorithmic bias is overcome by user empowerment, through the individual, conscious, informed personalization of algorithmic criteria.

The algorithm deciding what to show or prioritize in a feed should be simply and straightforwardly built and modified by the user as if it was a building block.
