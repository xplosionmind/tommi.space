## Quitting Social Media

I made a life-changing choice: Iâ€™ll **delete all of my Social Media accounts** by the end of 2020. There are a lot of reasons why I got to this point, and I discuss about this topic  **all  the  time**  with my friends. At the moment my aim is to put together resources, articles, videos, documentaries and documents in [this website](https://quitsocialmedia.club). Randomly stuffed, everything is [here](/internet-freedom/), in the meanwhile.

## Planning a Festival

We have no website, no detailed schedule, no definite and clear structure. We are a group of curious, different and crazy guys from all over Italy and we have an idea, a place, a time: a **festival of meetings** (which is way better than is sounds), in **Sanremo**, in August 2021. Itâ€™s already been one year since we're working on this and we founded an association. Iâ€™m its president (ðŸ¤¯).

Usually, Iâ€™d suggest to subscribe to a newsletter, or Iâ€™d point to a website, but as of right now we donâ€™t have anything like this. We're working on it. Keep in touch.

## Studying

Iâ€™m attending [Philosophy, International Studies and Economics](https://unive.it/pise) at [Caâ€™ Foscari University](https://unive.it) in [Venice](https://www.comune.venezia.it/), Italy, where Iâ€™m living.

## Projects, ideas, and collaborations

In the meanwhile, Iâ€™m continuing to wander around Italy to take part and/or assist to whatâ€™s happening. I take note to the most important stuff [here](/stuff/), and [here](/tuttopiu/) I log everything (literally anything) Iâ€™m doing.
