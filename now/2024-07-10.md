## 🏖️ Resting

<a href='/berlino/' title='Cara Berlino – tommi.space' hreflang='it'>I just moved away from Berlin</a>, and I am spending the summer in Riva Ligure, my hometown.

I am terrible at dedicating long periods of time to actual and complete rest, but I am making an effort to do so, in light of the important changes on the horizon:

## 💭 Preparing for what’s next

On August 23<sup>rd</sup> I will be moving to Tallinn, where I will start the <cite>[Artificial Intelligence and Sustainable Societies](https://aissprogram.eu 'AISS program website')</cite> Erasmus Mundus Joint Master.

It is a big step for me, both because it is a major event, and because I am not sure I am ready to get back to studying. It’s for this reason that I’m trying to prepare as well as I can, and get rid of as many chores as possible before I leave.

## 🪡 <cite>Knitting Our Internet</cite> 🧶

I am so glad [my workshop on the Fediverse](/fedilab/ 'Fediverse workshop – tommi.space') got overwhelmingly positive feedback in the past year!

So, I put together an incredible international team of marvelous and skilled people to structure it more, enrich the related material, develop a consistent and cool look for it, and to publish a website about it.

The enhanced workshop will be titled **🪡 <cite>Knitting Our Internet</cite> 🧶**. We believe we’ll have something ready around the end of August.

## 🤔 The future of <cite>Scambi Festival</cite>

In 2020, I founded <cite>[Scambi](https://scambi.org 'Scambi, The Festival of Paneurethic Workshops')</cite>, and I was its president up to when I moved to Berlin, in September 2023.

In the past few months, the festival and the team had a hard time, and I am jumping back in to help out and to think about our next steps, together.

I am taking advantage of the fact I am in the area to participate to many meetings with the association’s members, with the newly elected city council members of Sanremo, and with potential supporters to define the road ahead of us.

## 📡 Experimenting with Raspberry Pi

I have been planning for a very long time to put a stable and cool [storage](/storage/) system into place. Finally, I am spending enough time at home to go at my grandparents’ and set up a home server running [Photoprism](https://photoprism.app), powered by a [Raspberry Pi 5](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-5/). It is much trickier than I expected.

I am taking notes about this endeavor on the [DYI Home Server](/aby/) page.

## 🤯 Who am I kidding?

Who am I kidding? I will not be resting much this summer… 😑

## ✍🏼 Writing

I told myself that I would commit to carve out some time to focus on comprehensively revising [my bachelor’s thesis](/csss/) to make into a novel titled as the workshop.

I am not doing it as much as I wanted, but I am keeping the mindset.
