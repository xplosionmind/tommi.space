## ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî• Working with the DWeb Community

I have been hired as the [DWeb Social Media and Community Manager](https://getdweb.net/social-media-comms-job-2025/ 'Open Position: DWeb Social Media and Community Manager [Leave Coverage]')! Until July, I will have the honour, the privilege, and the responsibility to manage the DWeb Community‚Äôs social network profiles, and to facilitate the communication with/among the DWeb Nodes and volunteers based literally **all over the world**!

## üì° Weaving connections at Village One

Last October, I reached out to incredible folks at [Village One](https://www.village.one 'Village One‚Äôs website'), sharing my admiration for their work and the crucial **cooperative values** they pursue.

After a chat and exchanging a few emails, we realised we reeeaaally wanted to work together, so I was recently nominated Village One‚Äôs *Connections Weaver* (it really is my job title, I can‚Äôt believe it). We will be [experimenting](https://toot.village.one/@VillageOneCoop/114019694195185965 'Village One‚Äôs post on the Fediverse') a bit, and we will see where this collaboration leads us to.

## üñ•Ô∏è Self-hosted photo management

Rarely I am in my hometown long enough to address more complex and and time consuming technical chores using [Linuxplosion](content/jam/public/Linuxplosion.md).

I plan to stay home for a while, so I‚Äôll be completely rearranging and restructuring my audiovisual archive on [Aby](content/jam/public/Aby.md), at last. It is going to be an infinite, stressful, and excruciating work, but I absolutely must get it done, so I can forget about it.
