## Studying

I am living in [Venice](https://www.comune.venezia.it/ 'Venice institutional website'), Italy, where I am attending [Philosophy, International Studies and Economics](https://unive.it/pise 'PISE course page on UniVe website') at [Ca’ Foscari University](https://unive.it 'Ca’ Foscari University website').

## Working on <cite>Scambi Festival</cite>

With [a group of curious and crazy guys](https://scambi.org/en/about-us/ 'About us - Scambi Festival') from all over Italy, I founded and work at a Festival of workshops named [<cite>Scambi</cite>](https://scambi.org 'Scambi'), taking place in **Sanremo**, during the last week of August. The first edition, in 2021, has been a great success. We cannot wait for the second to happen, we are already working on it!

Everything about our festival is on <a href='https://scambi.org'  target='_blank' title='Scambi'>our website</a>

## Projects, ideas, and collaborations

In the meanwhile, I am continuing to wander around Italy to take part and/or assist to interesting things that happen. I take note of the most important stuff [here](/stuff 'Stuff - tommi.space'), and in <q lang=it>Tutto</q> I log everything (literally anything) I have done.
