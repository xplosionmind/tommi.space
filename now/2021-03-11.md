## Studying

I am living in [Venice](https://www.comune.venezia.it/ 'Venice institutional website'), Italy, where I am attending [Philosophy, International Studies and Economics](https://unive.it/pise 'PISE course page on UniVe website') at [Ca' Foscari University](https://unive.it 'Caâ€™ Foscari University website').

## Planning <cite>Scambi Festival</cite>

With a group of curious, different and crazy guys from all over Italy, I am organizing a cultural Festival. Its name is [<cite>Scambi</cite>](https://scambi.org 'Scambi'), and it is taking place in **Sanremo**, during the last week of August 2021. It is already been one year since we started working on this and we founded an association.

Everything about us and what we do is on [our website](https://scambi.org 'Scambi, Il Festival dei Laboratori Paneuretici').

## Projects, ideas, and collaborations

In the meanwhile, I am continuing to wander around Italy to take part and/or assist to interesting things that happen. I take note of the most important stuff [here](/stuff/ 'Stuff - tommi.space'), and in <q lang=it>Tutto</q> I log everything (literally anything) I have done.
