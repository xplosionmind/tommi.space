## Studying

I am a student of [Philosophy, International Studies and Economics](https://unive.it/pise 'PISE course page on UniVe website') at [Ca’ Foscari University](https://unive.it 'Ca’ Foscari University website').

### Writing my thesis

I am writing my bachelor thesis on the broad topic linking Computer Sciences to Sociology. I decided to publish and keep updated my notes, [here](/csss/).

## Working on <cite>Scambi Festival</cite>

render 'scambi.html'

## Aministrating <cite>Pan</cite>

<cite>[Pan](https://pan.rent 'Pan social')</cite> is a Fediverse node I conceived and I maintain together with <cite>APS Oltre</cite>, the same association organizing <cite>Scambi Festival</cite>

## Projects, ideas, and collaborations

In the meanwhile, I am continuing to wander around Italy to take part and/or assist to interesting things that happen. I take note of the most important stuff [here](https://tommi.space/stuff 'Stuff - tommi.space'), and <a href='https://tommi.space/tutto' hreflang='it' title='Tutto quello che ho fatto'>here</a> I log everything (literally anything) I have done.
