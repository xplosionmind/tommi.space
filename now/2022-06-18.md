## Projects, ideas, and collaborations

In the meanwhile, I am continuing to wander around Italy to take part and/or assist to interesting things that happen. I take note of the most important stuff [here](/stuff 'Stuff - tommi.space'), and <a href='/tutto' hreflang='it' target='_blank' title='Tutto quello che ho fatto'>here</a> I log everything (literally anything) I have done.
