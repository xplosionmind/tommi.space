## 🧘 Slowing down

Every evening, while getting into bed, I feel that Terrestrials are doomed, devoured by Surveillance Capitalism, Fascism, greed, and egoism. In this global environment, it is *so* hard for me to have deep introspective reflections, and decide what I truly want to focus my inevitably limited energies on. How can I say <q>no</q> to something, if I believe it could contribute at least a tiny bit to saving us from the abyss we are sliding towards?

So here I am, at a point where I have so many inputs, ideas, and ongoing projects that I feel compelled to do all I can to pursue them, yet, I want and I *need* to slow down, to do less, and to do it ~~better~~ **more mindfully**.

I am doing by best to frame all my current endeavours, shared in this page, within this perspective.

## 👾 Studying at XPUB

I started an insanely awesome interdisciplinary master degree: I will be studying at [XPUB](https://xpub.nl 'Experimental Publishing Master') **until July 2027**.

This course is **exactly what I have been looking for**. I am finding it super enriching, brilliantly critical, and very inspiring.

There are many incredible and intertwined stories about how I ended up here, how it’s going, and about the projects I am working on in the context of the course. I am narrating all of them in my <cite>[**XPUB Tales**](/xpub/)</cite>, and I will do my best to keep track of my work in [my personal page of the XPUB wiki](https://pzwiki.wdka.nl/mediadesign/User:Tommi 'Tommi’s user page on XPUB’s Wiki').

## 🌆 Settling in Rotterdam

Because of XPUB, I moved to Rotterdam. I don’t love this city as much as I loved [other cities](/places/ 'Around The World') I have lived in—yet. Nevertheless, I am so glad and so excited I am in a place that is full of super interesting cultural activities and activist collectives—see below.

Amidst all this ferment, once again, it’s very hard to choose what *not* to do, but I am doing my best to be involved in endeavours I find compelling, stimulating, and helpful.

[Here](/rotterdam/) I am keeping some notes with various information and thoughts about the **life in Rotterdam**.

## 🧐 Guest Residency at Foundation B.a.d

In the South of Rotterdam there is a very special neighbourhood, called [Charlois](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlois 'Charlois on Wikipedia'). It has a particular history, and a very vibrant art scene. It is like this also thanks to a group of art students who squatted an abandoned school in 1987, turning the classrooms in their studios and homes.

This special place is now <cite>[**Foundation B.a.d**](https://www.foundationbad.nl/)</cite>, and I am so glad I have been selected for [a guest residency](https://www.foundationbad.nl/guest-studios/) there.

As the main project for my residency, I want to host a serie of screenings about homelessness, precariety, and basically how **Capitalism and gentrification are devastating lives and increasing inequality**. I would love to explore this topic through fiction and non-fiction films, also with my fellow resident [Ariela Bergman](https://artoffice.info/kunstenaar/ariela-bergman/ 'Ariela Bergman on ArtOffice.info'). We are very open for inputs, considerations, and ideas! [More information here](/bad-rent/).

## ✊ Fighting for housing rights 🏘️

There is [an insane housing crisis in the Netherlands](https://www.theguardian.com/news/article/2024/may/06/netherlands-amsterdam-next-level-housing-crisis '‘Everything’s just … on hold’: the Netherlands’ next-level housing crisis'). I have faced its hardships myself, as it is taking me [**more than six months to find a home**](/rotterdam/rent/).

I believe we can overcome this only by a collective and political committment to make things better **for everyone**, not just for ourselves. This is why am proud to be part of <cite lang=nl><a href=https://buurtoren.nl/en/ hreflang=en>BuurToren</a></cite>, a project to provide housing to all those in need, and <a href=https://bondprecairewoonvormen.nl/en/ lang=nl hreflang=en>Bond Precaire Woonvormen</a> (BPW) a union for people living in precarious situations.

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Collectivizing Scambi Festival’s bureaucratic backbone

[Scambi Festival 2025](https://scambi.org/en/2025/ 'Scambi Festival 2025') had a new, cozy, and chill format, that made us understand that we have to be easy on ourselves if we really want to enjoy what we do and make it a meaningful experience for the participants. This starts from collectivizing our efforts and reaying on mindful teamwork, especially for bureaucratic chores.

I am still the president of the association that runs the festival, but for the same reasons I wrote about so far, I want to focus on doing less, and more locally. Therefore, I am making an effort to pass to the rest of the board and to the staff all that I learned in the five years since I co-founded the association.

## 🔌 Setting up my homelab

Even if I have no permanent home so far, I brought *all* my technical equipment to Rotterdam, including [Linuxplosion](content/jam/public/Linuxplosion.md), and [Aby](content/jam/public/Aby.md). During the summer, I also assembled a low-power server that I plan to use as my main homelab, hosting all my personal data, so that it does not stay in a random VPS somewhere.
