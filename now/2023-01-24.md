## Studying

I am living in [Venice](https://comune.venezia.it 'Venice institutional website'), Italy, where I am a student of [Philosophy, International Studies and Economics](https://unive.it/pise 'PISE course page on UniVe website') at [Ca’ Foscari University](https://unive.it 'Ca’ Foscari University website').

### Writing my thesis

I am writing my bachelor thesis on the broad topic linking Computer Sciences to Sociology. I decided to publish and keep updated my notes, [here](/csss/).

## Working on <cite>Scambi Festival</cite>

	<p>I conceived and co-founded <cite lang='it'>Scambi</cite>, <strong>The Festival of <a href='https://scambi.org/paneurethic' target='_blank' title='The Paneurethic Universe of Scambi'>Paneurethic</a> <a href='https://scambi.org/en/labs' target='_blank' title='What Scambi’s Labs are'>Labs</a></strong>. I organize it with <a href='https://scambi.org/en/about-us' title='About Us — scambi.org'>a staff</a> of <strong><em>under-25</em> volunteers</strong>. The festival takes place during the last week of August in <a href='https://scambi.org/en/manifesto#la-pigna%2C-our-roots' target='_blank' title='The section about La Pigna in out manifesto'><cite>La Pigna</cite>, Sanremo</a>, Italy.<br>The festival was born from our urge to <strong>fight the intolerance</strong> towards anything or anyone different. While our planet is getting hotter and drier every day, <u>relationships of the people living on it are getting colder and more feeble</u>.<br>Our purpose is to overcome this tendency by bringing together the most different guests and public.</p>

## Aministrating <cite>Pan</cite>

<cite>[Pan](https://pan.rent 'Pan social')</cite> is a Fediverse node I conceived and I maintain together with <cite>APS Oltre</cite>, the same association organizing <cite>Scambi Festival</cite>

## Projects, ideas, and collaborations

In the meanwhile, I am continuing to wander around Italy to take part and/or assist to interesting things that happen. I take note of the most important stuff [here](https://tommi.space/stuff 'Stuff - tommi.space'), and <a href='https://tommi.space/tutto' hreflang='it' title='Tutto quello che ho fatto'>here</a> I log everything (literally anything) I have done.
