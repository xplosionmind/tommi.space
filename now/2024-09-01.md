## 💭 AISS Erasmus Mundus Joint Master

I just moved to Tallinn, Estonia, where I am starting an [Erasmus Mundus Joint Master](https://www.eacea.ec.europa.eu/scholarships/erasmus-mundus-catalogue_en 'Erasmus Mundus Joint Masters Catalogue – European Union') in <cite>[Artificial Intelligence and Sustainable Societies](https://aissprogram.eu 'AISS program website')</cite>.

I have mixed feelings about the course, but the people are nice, the professors are very open and welcoming, so I am psyched to begin this new special experience!

## 🪡 <cite>Knitting Our Internet</cite> 🧶

I am so glad [my workshop on the Fediverse](/fedilab/ 'Fediverse workshop – tommi.space') got overwhelmingly positive feedback in the past year!

So, I put together an incredible international team of marvelous and skilled people to structure it more, enrich the related material, develop a consistent and cool look for it, and to publish a website about it.

The enhanced workshop will be titled **🪡 <cite>Knitting Our Internet</cite> 🧶**. We believe we’ll have something ready ~~around the end of August~~sometime in the near future.

## 🤔 The future of <cite>Scambi Festival</cite>

In 2020, I founded <cite>[Scambi](https://scambi.org 'Scambi, The Festival of Paneurethic Workshops')</cite>. In the past few months, the festival and the team had a hard time, and I am jumping back in to help out and to think about our next steps, together. I got back to being its president, and I am taking care of the bureaucracy for the time being.

## ✍🏼 Writing

I told myself that I would commit to carve out some time to focus on comprehensively revising [my bachelor’s thesis](/csss/) to make into a novel titled as the workshop.

I am not doing it as much as I wanted, but I am keeping the mindset.
