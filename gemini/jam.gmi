# The Jam

Online, you may stumble upon it as a Digital Garden, or it may be defined as a Zettelkasten system. Mine, instead, is definitely less ambitious; yet, it is whipped, fragmented, juicy and sweet. It is a jam.

I happen to make curious discoveries, as well as I end up having interesting thoughts which I need to save before they end up forgotten or while I find the right words to reformulate them and place them in the Zibaldone.

I take all of these things and I make The Jam out of them.
