# Tommi’s mind

This is just an experimental endpoint for the representation of Tommi’s mind in the awesome Gemini universe.

=> gemini://tommi.space/about.gmi Who is Tommi?

Unfortunately, the full experience of the chaos inside Tommi’s brain can be fully experienced only from its regular (but still weird and whimsical) web endpoint:

Still, I am playing a bit with some scripts and I am managing to publish some content on here. “Zibaldone” is my pseudo-blog, and “The Jam” hosts my pseudo-notes.
