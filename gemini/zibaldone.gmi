# Zibaldone

Zibaldone di Pensieri is a great collection of notes by the celebre italian author Giacomo Leopardi. These writings do not have even a tiny bit of profoundness, power and wit of the original collection. Just a touch of glee, craziness of my everyday life.

Translating the definition by Treccani encyclopedia:

> żibaldóne: […] Notebook where unordered news, notes, thoughts, quotes, schemes, sketches are noted
